behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).\n\n\n\n\n**New! Learn Redux from its creator:Getting Started with Redux (30 free videos)**Testimonials“Love what you're doing with Redux”Jing Chen, creator of Flux“I asked for comments on Redux in FB's internal JS discussion group, and it was universally praised. Really awesome work.”Bill Fisher, author of Flux documentation“It's cool that you are inventing a better Flux by not doing Flux at all.”André Staltz, creator of CycleDeveloper ExperienceI wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called “Hot Reloading with Time Travel”. My goal was to create a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.InfluencesRedux evolves the ideas of Flux, but avoids its complexity by taking cues from Elm.Whether you have used them or not, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.InstallationTo install the stable version:npm install --save redux\nThis assumes you are using npm as your package manager.If you don't, you can access these files on unpkg, download them, or point your package manager to them.Most commonly people consume Redux as a collection of CommonJS modules. These modules are what you get when you import redux in a Webpack, Browserify, or a Node environment. If you like to live on the edge and use Rollup, we support that as well.If you don't use a module bundler, it's also fine. The redux npm package includes precompiled production and development UMD builds in the dist folder. They can be used directly without a bundler and are thus compatible with many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. For example, you can drop a UMD build as a  tag on the page, or tell Bower to install it. The UMD builds make Redux available as a window.Redux global variable.The Redux source code is written in ES2015 but we precompile both CommonJS and UMD builds to ES5 so they work in any modern browser. You don't need to use Babel or a module bundler to get started with Redux.Complementary PackagesMost likely, you'll also need the React bindings and the developer tools.npm install --save react-redux\nnpm install --save-dev redux-devtools\nNote that unlike Redux itself, many packages in the Redux ecosystem don't provide UMD builds, so we recommend using CommonJS module bundlers like Webpack and Browserify for the most comfortable development experience.The GistThe whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers.That's it!import { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer, a pure function with (state, action) => state signature.\n * It describes how an action transforms the state into the next state.\n *\n * The shape of the state is up to you: it can be a primitive, an array, an object,\n * or even an Immutable.js data structure. The only important part is that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * In this example, we use a `switch` statement and strings, but you can use a helper that\n * follows a different convention (such as function maps) if it makes sense for your\n * project.\n */\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n  case 'INCREMENT':\n    return state + 1\n  case 'DECREMENT':\n    return state - 1\n  default:\n    return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counter)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// However it can also be handy to persist the current state in the localStorage.\n\nstore.subscribe(() =>\n  console.log(store.getState())\n)\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n// 1\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n// 2\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })\n// 1\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called actions. Then you write a special function called a reducer to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.If you're coming from Flux, there is a single important difference you need to understand. Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, instead of adding stores, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.This architecture might seem like an overkill for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.Learn Redux from Its CreatorGetting Started with Redux is a video course consisting of 30 videos narrated by Dan Abramov, author of Redux.

This state can include server responses and cached data, as well as locally created data that has not yet been persisted to the server. UI state is also increasing in complexity, as we need to manage the active route, the selected tab, whether to show a spinner or not, should pagination controls be displayed, and so on.Managing this ever-changing state is hard. If a model can update another model, then a view can update a model, which updates another model, and this, in turn, might cause another view to update. At some point, you no longer understand what happens in your app as you have lost control over the when, why, and how of its state. When a system is opaque and non-deterministic, it's hard to reproduce bugs or add new features.As if this wasn't bad enough, consider the new requirements becoming common in front-end product development. As developers, we are expected to handle optimistic updates, server-side rendering, fetching data before performing route transitions, and so on. We find ourselves trying to manage a complexity that we have never had to deal with before, and we inevitably ask the question: is it time to give up? The answer is no.This complexity is difficult to handle as we're mixing two concepts that are very hard for the human mind to reason about: mutation and asynchronicity. I call them Mentos and Coke. Both can be great in separation, but together they create a mess. Libraries like React attempt to solve this problem in the view layer by removing both asynchrony and direct DOM manipulation. However, managing the state of your data is left up to you. This is where Redux enters.Following in the steps of Flux, CQRS, and Event Sourcing, Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable by imposing certain restrictions on how and when updates can happen. These restrictions are reflected in the three principles of Redux."},"docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html","title":"Three Principles","keywords":"","body":"Three PrinciplesRedux can be described in three fundamental principles:Single source of truthThe state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.This makes it easy to create universal apps, as the state from your server can be serialized and hydrated into the client with no extra coding effort. A single state tree also makes it easier to debug or introspect an application; it also enables you to persist your app's state in development, for a faster development cycle. Some functionality which has been traditionally difficult to implement - Undo/Redo, for example - can suddenly become trivial to implement, if all of your state is stored in a single tree.console.log(store.getState())\n\n/* Prints\n{\n  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',\n  todos: [\n    {\n      text: 'Consider using Redux',\n      completed: true,\n    },\n    {\n      text: 'Keep all state in a single tree',\n      completed: false\n    }\n  ]\n}\n*/\nState is read-onlyThe only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state. Instead, they express an intent to transform the state. Because all changes are centralized and happen one by one in a strict order, there are no subtle race conditions to watch out for. As actions are just plain objects, they can be logged, serialized, stored, and later replayed for debugging or testing purposes.store.dispatch({\n  type: 'COMPLETE_TODO',\n  index: 1\n})\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',\n  filter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'\n})\nChanges are made with pure functionsTo specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state. Remember to return new state objects, instead of mutating the previous state. You can start with a single reducer, and as your app grows, split it off into smaller reducers that manage specific parts of the state tree. Because reducers are just functions, you can control the order in which they are called, pass additional data, or even make reusable reducers for common tasks such as pagination.\nfunction visibilityFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER':\n      return action.filter\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        {\n          text: action.text,\n          completed: false\n        }\n      ]\n    case 'COMPLETE_TODO':\n      return state.map((todo, index) => {\n        if (index === action.index) {\n          return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n            completed: true\n          })\n        }\n        return todo\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nimport { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux'\nlet reducer = combineReducers({ visibilityFilter, todos })\nlet store = createStore(reducer)\nThat's it! Now you know what Redux is all about."},"docs/introduction/PriorArt.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/PriorArt.html","title":"Prior Art","keywords":"","body":"Prior ArtRedux has a mixed heritage. It is similar to some patterns and technologies, but is also different from them in important ways. We'll explore some of the similarities and the differences below.FluxCan Redux be considered a Flux implementation?Yes, and no.(Don't worry, Flux creators approve of it, if that's all you wanted to know.)Redux was inspired by several important qualities of Flux. Like Flux, Redux prescribes that you concentrate your model update logic in a certain layer of your application (“stores” in Flux, “reducers” in Redux). Instead of letting the application code directly mutate the data, both tell you to describe every mutation as a plain object called an “action”.Unlike Flux, Redux does not have the concept of a Dispatcher. This is because it relies on pure functions instead of event emitters, and pure functions are easy to compose and don't need an additional entity managing them. Depending on how you view Flux, you may see this as either a deviation or an implementation detail. Flux has often been described as (state, action) => state. In this sense, Redux is true to the Flux architecture, but makes it simpler thanks to pure functions.Another important difference from Flux is that Redux assumes you never mutate your data. You can use plain objects and arrays for your state just fine, but mutating them inside the reducers is strongly discouraged. You should always return a new object, which is easy with the object spread operator proposal, or with a library like Immutable.While it is technically possible to write impure reducers that mutate the data for performance corner cases, we actively discourage you from doing this. Development features like time travel, record/replay, or hot reloading will break. Moreover it doesn't seem like immutability poses performance problems in most real apps, because, as Om demonstrates, even if you lose out on object allocation, you still win by avoiding expensive re-renders and re-calculations, as you know exactly what changed thanks to reducer purity.ElmElm is a functional programming language inspired by Haskell and created by Evan Czaplicki. It enforces a “model view update” architecture, where the update has the following signature: (action, state) => state. Elm “updaters” serve the same purpose as reducers in Redux.Unlike Redux, Elm is a language, so it is able to benefit from many things like enforced purity, static typing, out of the box immutability, and pattern matching (using the case expression). Even if you don't plan to use Elm, you should read about the Elm architecture, and play with it. There is an interesting JavaScript library playground implementing similar ideas. We should look there for inspiration on Redux! One way that we can get closer to the static typing of Elm is by using a gradual typing solution like Flow.ImmutableImmutable is a JavaScript library implementing persistent data structures. It is performant and has an idiomatic JavaScript API.Immutable and most similar libraries are orthogonal to Redux. Feel free to use them together!Redux doesn't care how you store the state—it can be a plain object, an Immutable object, or anything else. You'll probably want a (de)serialization mechanism for writing universal apps and hydrating their state from the server, but other than that, you can use any data storage library as long as it supports immutability. For example, it doesn't make sense to use Backbone for Redux state, because Backbone models are mutable.Note that, even if your immutable library supports cursors, you shouldn't use them in a Redux app. The whole state tree should be considered read-only, and you should use Redux for updating the state, and subscribing to the updates. Therefore writing via cursor doesn't make sense for Redux. If your only use case for cursors is decoupling the state tree from the UI tree and gradually refining the cursors, you should look at selectors instead. Selectors are composable getter functions. See reselect for a really great and concise implementation of composable selectors.BaobabBaobab is another popular library implementing immutable API for updating plain JavaScript objects. While you can use it with Redux, there is little benefit in using them together.Most of the functionality Baobab provides is related to updating the data with cursors, but Redux enforces that the only way to update the data is to dispatch an action. Therefore they solve the same problem differently, and don't complement each other.Unlike Immutable, Baobab doesn't yet implement any special efficient data structures under the hood, so you don't really win anything from using it together with Redux. It's easier to just use plain objects in this case.RxReactive Extensions (and their undergoing modern rewrite) are a superb way to manage the complexity of asynchronous apps. In fact there is an effort to create a library that models human-computer interaction as interdependent observables.Does it make sense to use Redux together with Rx? Sure! They work great together. For example, it is easy to expose a Redux store as an observable:function toObservable(store) {\n  return {\n    subscribe({ onNext }) {\n      let dispose = store.subscribe(() => onNext(store.getState()))\n      onNext(store.getState())\n      return { dispose }\n    }\n  }\n}\nSimilarly, you can compose different asynchronous streams to turn them into actions before feeding them to store.dispatch().The question is: do you really need Redux if you already use Rx? Maybe not. It's not hard to re-implement Redux in Rx. Some say it's a two-liner using Rx .scan() method. It may very well be!If you're in doubt, check out the Redux source code (there isn't much going on there), as well as its ecosystem (for example, the developer tools). If you don't care too much about it and want to go with the reactive data flow all the way, you might want to explore something like Cycle instead, or even combine it with Redux. Let us know how it goes!"},"docs/introduction/Ecosystem.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/Ecosystem.html","title":"Ecosystem","keywords":"","body":"EcosystemRedux is a tiny library, but its contracts and APIs are carefully chosen to spawn an ecosystem of tools and extensions.For an extensive list of everything related to Redux, we recommend Awesome Redux.

If you're new to Flux, it's easy too!In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a simple Todo app.Actions\n\nReducers\n\nStore\n\nData Flow\n\nUsage with React\n\nExample: Todo List\n\n"},"docs/basics/Actions.html":{"url":"docs/basics/Actions.html","title":"Actions","keywords":"","body":"ActionsFirst, let's define some actions.Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. You send them to the store using store.dispatch().Here's an example action which represents adding a new todo item:const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'\n{\n  type: ADD_TODO,\n  text: 'Build my first Redux app'\n}\nActions are plain JavaScript objects. Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed. Types should typically be defined as string constants. Once your app is large enough, you may want to move them into a separate module.import { ADD_TODO, REMOVE_TODO } from '../actionTypes'\nNote on BoilerplateYou don't have to define action type constants in a separate file, or even to define them at all. For a small project, it might be easier to just use string literals for action types. However, there are some benefits to explicitly declaring constants in larger codebases. Read Reducing Boilerplate for more practical tips on keeping your codebase clean.Other than type, the structure of an action object is really up to you. If you're interested, check out Flux Standard Action for recommendations on how actions could be constructed.We'll add one more action type to describe a user ticking off a todo as completed. We refer to a particular todo by index because we store them in an array. In a real app, it is wiser to generate a unique ID every time something new is created.{\n  type: TOGGLE_TODO,\n  index: 5\n}\nIt's a good idea to pass as little data in each action as possible. For example, it's better to pass index than the whole todo object.Finally, we'll add one more action type for changing the currently visible todos.{\n  type: SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER,\n  filter: SHOW_COMPLETED\n}\nAction CreatorsAction creators are exactly that—functions that create actions. It's easy to conflate the terms “action” and “action creator,” so do your best to use the proper term.In Redux action creators simply return an action:function addTodo(text) {\n  return {\n    type: ADD_TODO,\n    text\n  }\n}\nThis makes them portable and easy to test.In traditional Flux, action creators often trigger a dispatch when invoked, like so:function addTodoWithDispatch(text) {\n  const action = {\n    type: ADD_TODO,\n    text\n  }\n  dispatch(action)\n}\nIn Redux this is not the case.Instead, to actually initiate a dispatch, pass the result to the dispatch() function:dispatch(addTodo(text))\ndispatch(completeTodo(index))\nAlternatively, you can create a bound action creator that automatically dispatches:const boundAddTodo = (text) => dispatch(addTodo(text))\nconst boundCompleteTodo = (index) => dispatch(completeTodo(index))\nNow you'll be able to call them directly:boundAddTodo(text)\nboundCompleteTodo(index)\nThe dispatch() function can be accessed directly from the store as store.dispatch(), but more likely you'll access it using a helper like react-redux's connect(). You can use bindActionCreators() to automatically bind many action creators to a dispatch() function.Action creators can also be asynchronous and have side-effects. You can read about async actions in the advanced tutorial to learn how to handle AJAX responses and compose action creators into async control flow. Don't skip ahead to async actions until you've completed the basics tutorial, as it covers other important concepts that are prerequisite for the advanced tutorial and async actions.Source Codeactions.js/*\n * action types\n */\n\nexport const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'\nexport const TOGGLE_TODO = 'TOGGLE_TODO'\nexport const SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER = 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER'\n\n/*\n * other constants\n */\n\nexport const VisibilityFilters = {\n  SHOW_ALL: 'SHOW_ALL',\n  SHOW_COMPLETED: 'SHOW_COMPLETED',\n  SHOW_ACTIVE: 'SHOW_ACTIVE'\n}\n\n/*\n * action creators\n */\n\nexport function addTodo(text) {\n  return { type: ADD_TODO, text }\n}\n\nexport function toggleTodo(index) {\n  return { type: TOGGLE_TODO, index }\n}\n\nexport function setVisibilityFilter(filter) {\n  return { type: SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER, filter }\n}\nNext StepsNow let's define some reducers to specify how the state updates when you dispatch these actions!"},"docs/basics/Reducers.html":{"url":"docs/basics/Reducers.html","title":"Reducers","keywords":"","body":"ReducersActions describe the fact that something happened, but don't specify how the application's state changes in response. This is the job of a reducer.Designing the State ShapeIn Redux, all application state is stored as a single object. It's a good idea to think of its shape before writing any code. What's the minimal representation of your app's state as an object?For our todo app, we want to store two different things:The currently selected visibility filter;\n\nThe actual list of todos.\n\nYou'll often find that you need to store some data, as well as some UI state, in the state tree. This is fine, but try to keep the data separate from the UI state.{\n  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',\n  todos: [\n    {\n      text: 'Consider using Redux',\n      completed: true,\n    },\n    {\n      text: 'Keep all state in a single tree',\n      completed: false\n    }\n  ]\n}\nNote on RelationshipsIn a more complex app, you're going to want different entities to reference each other. We suggest that you keep your state as normalized as possible, without any nesting. Keep every entity in an object stored with an ID as a key, and use IDs to reference it from other entities, or lists. Think of the app's state as a database. This approach is described in normalizr's documentation in detail. For example, keeping todosById: { id -> todo } and todos: array inside the state would be a better idea in a real app, but we're keeping the example simple.Handling ActionsNow that we've decided what our state object looks like, we're ready to write a reducer for it. The reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.(previousState, action) => newState\nIt's called a reducer because it's the type of function you would pass to Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue). It's very important that the reducer stays pure. Things you should never do inside a reducer:Mutate its arguments;\n\nPerform side effects like API calls and routing transitions;\n\nCall non-pure functions, e.g. Date.now() or Math.random().\n\nWe'll explore how to perform side effects in the advanced walkthrough. For now, just remember that the reducer must be pure. Given the same arguments, it should calculate the next state and return it. No surprises. No side effects. No API calls. No mutations. Just a calculation.With this out of the way, let's start writing our reducer by gradually teaching it to understand the actions we defined earlier.We'll start by specifying the initial state. Redux will call our reducer with an undefined state for the first time. This is our chance to return the initial state of our app:import { VisibilityFilters } from './actions'\n\nconst initialState = {\n  visibilityFilter: VisibilityFilters.SHOW_ALL,\n  todos: []\n}\n\nfunction todoApp(state, action) {\n  if (typeof state === 'undefined') {\n    return initialState\n  }\n\n  // For now, don't handle any actions\n  // and just return the state given to us.\n  return state\n}\nOne neat trick is to use the ES6 default arguments syntax to write this in a more compact way:function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  // For now, don't handle any actions\n  // and just return the state given to us.\n  return state\n}\nNow let's handle SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER. All it needs to do is to change visibilityFilter on the state. Easy:function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        visibilityFilter: action.filter\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\nNote that:We don't mutate the state. We create a copy with Object.assign(). Object.assign(state, { visibilityFilter: action.filter }) is also wrong: it will mutate the first argument. You must supply an empty object as the first parameter. You can also enable the object spread operator proposal to write { ...state, ...newState } instead.\nWe return the previous state in the default case. It's important to return the previous state for any unknown action.\nNote on Object.assignObject.assign() is a part of ES6, but is not implemented by most browsers yet. You'll need to either use a polyfill, a Babel plugin, or a helper from another library like _.assign().Note on switch and BoilerplateThe switch statement is not the real boilerplate. The real boilerplate of Flux is conceptual: the need to emit an update, the need to register the Store with a Dispatcher, the need for the Store to be an object (and the complications that arise when you want a universal app). Redux solves these problems by using pure reducers instead of event emitters.It's unfortunate that many still choose a framework based on whether it uses switch statements in the documentation. If you don't like switch, you can use a custom createReducer function that accepts a handler map, as shown in “reducing boilerplate”.Handling More ActionsWe have two more actions to handle! Let's extend our reducer to handle ADD_TODO.function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        visibilityFilter: action.filter\n      })\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        todos: [\n          ...state.todos,\n          {\n            text: action.text,\n            completed: false\n          }\n        ]\n      })    \n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\nJust like before, we never write directly to state or its fields, and instead we return new objects. The new todos is equal to the old todos concatenated with a single new item at the end. The fresh todo was constructed using the data from the action.Finally, the implementation of the TOGGLE_TODO handler shouldn't come as a complete surprise:case TOGGLE_TODO:\n  return Object.assign({}, state, {\n    todos: state.todos.map((todo, index) => {\n      if (index === action.index) {\n        return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n          completed: !todo.completed\n        })\n      }\n      return todo\n    })\n  })\nBecause we want to update a specific item in the array without resorting to mutations, we have to create a new array with the same items except the item at the index. If you find yourself often writing such operations, it's a good idea to use a helper like react-addons-update, updeep, or even a library like Immutable that has native support for deep updates. Just remember to never assign to anything inside the state unless you clone it first.Splitting ReducersHere is our code so far. It is rather verbose:function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        visibilityFilter: action.filter\n      })\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        todos: [\n          ...state.todos,\n          {\n            text: action.text,\n            completed: false\n          }\n        ]\n      })\n    case TOGGLE_TODO:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        todos: state.todos.map((todo, index) => {\n          if(index === action.index) {\n            return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n              completed: !todo.completed\n            })\n          }\n          return todo\n        })\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\nIs there a way to make it easier to comprehend? It seems like todos and visibilityFilter are updated completely independently. Sometimes state fields depend on one another and more consideration is required, but in our case we can easily split updating todos into a separate function:function todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        {\n          text: action.text,\n          completed: false\n        }\n      ]\n    case TOGGLE_TODO:\n      return state.map((todo, index) => {\n        if (index === action.index) {\n          return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n            completed: !todo.completed\n          })\n        }\n        return todo\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        visibilityFilter: action.filter\n      })\n    case ADD_TODO:\n    case TOGGLE_TODO:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        todos: todos(state.todos, action)\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\nNote that todos also accepts state—but it's an array! Now todoApp just gives it the slice of the state to manage, and todos knows how to update just that slice. This is called reducer composition, and it's the fundamental pattern of building Redux apps.Let's explore reducer composition more. Can we also extract a reducer managing just visibilityFilter? We can:function visibilityFilter(state = SHOW_ALL, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return action.filter\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\nNow we can rewrite the main reducer as a function that calls the reducers managing parts of the state, and combines them into a single object. It also doesn't need to know the complete initial state anymore. It's enough that the child reducers return their initial state when given undefined at first.function todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        {\n          text: action.text,\n          completed: false\n        }\n      ]\n    case TOGGLE_TODO:\n      return state.map((todo, index) => {\n        if (index === action.index) {\n          return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n            completed: !todo.completed\n          })\n        }\n        return todo\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction visibilityFilter(state = SHOW_ALL, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return action.filter\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction todoApp(state = {}, action) {\n  return {\n    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action),\n    todos: todos(state.todos, action)\n  }\n}\nNote that each of these reducers is managing its own part of the global state. The state parameter is different for every reducer, and corresponds to the part of the state it manages.This is already looking good! When the app is larger, we can split the reducers into separate files and keep them completely independent and managing different data domains.Finally, Redux provides a utility called combineReducers() that does the same boilerplate logic that the todoApp above currently does. With its help, we can rewrite todoApp like this:import { combineReducers } from 'redux'\n\nconst todoApp = combineReducers({\n  visibilityFilter,\n  todos\n})\n\nexport default todoApp\nNote that this is completely equivalent to:export default function todoApp(state = {}, action) {\n  return {\n    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action),\n    todos: todos(state.todos, action)\n  }\n}\nYou could also give them different keys, or call functions differently. These two ways to write a combined reducer are completely equivalent:const reducer = combineReducers({\n  a: doSomethingWithA,\n  b: processB,\n  c: c\n})\nfunction reducer(state = {}, action) {\n  return {\n    a: doSomethingWithA(state.a, action),\n    b: processB(state.b, action),\n    c: c(state.c, action)\n  }\n}\nAll combineReducers() does is generate a function that calls your reducers with the slices of state selected according to their keys, and combining their results into a single object again. It's not magic.Note for ES6 Savvy UsersBecause combineReducers expects an object, we can put all top-level reducers into a separate file, export each reducer function, and use import * as reducers to get them as an object with their names as the keys:import { combineReducers } from 'redux'\nimport * as reducers from './reducers'\n\nconst todoApp = combineReducers(reducers)\nBecause import * is still new syntax, we don't use it anymore in the documentation to avoid confusion, but you may encounter it in some community examples.Source Codereducers.jsimport { combineReducers } from 'redux'\nimport { ADD_TODO, TOGGLE_TODO, SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER, VisibilityFilters } from './actions'\nconst { SHOW_ALL } = VisibilityFilters\n\nfunction visibilityFilter(state = SHOW_ALL, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return action.filter\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        {\n          text: action.text,\n          completed: false\n        }\n      ]\n    case TOGGLE_TODO:\n      return state.map((todo, index) => {\n        if (index === action.index) {\n          return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n            completed: !todo.completed\n          })\n        }\n        return todo\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nconst todoApp = combineReducers({\n  visibilityFilter,\n  todos\n})\n\nexport default todoApp\nNext StepsNext, we'll explore how to create a Redux store that holds the state and takes care of calling your reducer when you dispatch an action."},"docs/basics/Store.html":{"url":"docs/basics/Store.html","title":"Store","keywords":"","body":"StoreIn the previous sections, we defined the actions that represent the facts about “what happened” and the reducers that update the state according to those actions.The Store is the object that brings them together. The store has the following responsibilities:Holds application state;\n\nAllows access to state via getState();\n\nAllows state to be updated via dispatch(action);\n\nRegisters listeners via subscribe(listener);\n\nHandles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).\n\nIt's important to note that you'll only have a single store in a Redux application. When you want to split your data handling logic, you'll use reducer composition instead of many stores.It's easy to create a store if you have a reducer. In the previous section, we used combineReducers() to combine several reducers into one. We will now import it, and pass it to createStore().import { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport todoApp from './reducers'\nlet store = createStore(todoApp)\nYou may optionally specify the initial state as the second argument to createStore(). This is useful for hydrating the state of the client to match the state of a Redux application running on the server.let store = createStore(todoApp, window.STATE_FROM_SERVER)\nDispatching ActionsNow that we have created a store, let's verify our program works! Even without any UI, we can already test the update logic.import { addTodo, toggleTodo, setVisibilityFilter, VisibilityFilters } from './actions'\n\n// Log the initial state\nconsole.log(store.getState())\n\n// Every time the state changes, log it\n// Note that subscribe() returns a function for unregistering the listener\nlet unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() =>\n  console.log(store.getState())\n)\n\n// Dispatch some actions\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('Learn about actions'))\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('Learn about reducers'))\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('Learn about store'))\nstore.dispatch(toggleTodo(0))\nstore.dispatch(toggleTodo(1))\nstore.dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(VisibilityFilters.SHOW_COMPLETED))\n\n// Stop listening to state updates\nunsubscribe()\nYou can see how this causes the state held by the store to change:We specified the behavior of our app before we even started writing the UI. We won't do this in this tutorial, but at this point you can write tests for your reducers and action creators. You won't need to mock anything because they are just pure functions. Call them, and make assertions on what they return.Source Codeindex.jsimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport todoApp from './reducers'\n\nlet store = createStore(todoApp)\nNext StepsBefore creating a UI for our todo app, we will take a detour to see how the data flows in a Redux application."},"docs/basics/DataFlow.html":{"url":"docs/basics/DataFlow.html","title":"Data Flow","keywords":"","body":"Data FlowRedux architecture revolves around a strict unidirectional data flow.This means that all data in an application follows the same lifecycle pattern, making the logic of your app more predictable and easier to understand. It also encourages data normalization, so that you don't end up with multiple, independent copies of the same data that are unaware of one another.If you're still not convinced, read Motivation and The Case for Flux for a compelling argument in favor of unidirectional data flow. Although Redux is not exactly Flux, it shares the same key benefits.The data lifecycle in any Redux app follows these 4 steps:You call store.dispatch(action).An action is a plain object describing what happened. For example: { type: 'LIKE_ARTICLE', articleId: 42 }\n { type: 'FETCH_USER_SUCCESS', response: { id: 3, name: 'Mary' } }\n { type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Read the Redux docs.' }\nThink of an action as a very brief snippet of news. “Mary liked article 42.” or “‘Read the Redux docs.' was added to the list of todos.”You can call store.dispatch(action) from anywhere in your app, including components and XHR callbacks, or even at scheduled intervals.\nThe Redux store calls the reducer function you gave it.The store will pass two arguments to the reducer: the current state tree and the action. For example, in the todo app, the root reducer might receive something like this: // The current application state (list of todos and chosen filter)\n let previousState = {\n   visibleTodoFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',\n   todos: [ \n     {\n       text: 'Read the docs.',\n       complete: false\n     }\n   ]\n }\n\n // The action being performed (adding a todo)\n let action = {\n   type: 'ADD_TODO',\n   text: 'Understand the flow.'\n }\n\n // Your reducer returns the next application state\n let nextState = todoApp(previousState, action)\nNote that a reducer is a pure function. It only computes the next state. It should be completely predictable: calling it with the same inputs many times should produce the same outputs. It shouldn't perform any side effects like API calls or router transitions. These should happen before an action is dispatched.\nThe root reducer may combine the output of multiple reducers into a single state tree.How you structure the root reducer is completely up to you. Redux ships with a combineReducers() helper function, useful for “splitting” the root reducer into separate functions that each manage one branch of the state tree.Here's how combineReducers() works. Let's say you have two reducers, one for a list of todos, and another for the currently selected filter setting: function todos(state = [], action) {\n   // Somehow calculate it...\n   return nextState\n }\n\n function visibleTodoFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {\n   // Somehow calculate it...\n   return nextState\n }\n\n let todoApp = combineReducers({\n   todos,\n   visibleTodoFilter\n })\nWhen you emit an action, todoApp returned by combineReducers will call both reducers: let nextTodos = todos(state.todos, action)\n let nextVisibleTodoFilter = visibleTodoFilter(state.visibleTodoFilter, action)\nIt will then combine both sets of results into a single state tree: return {\n   todos: nextTodos,\n   visibleTodoFilter: nextVisibleTodoFilter\n }\nWhile combineReducers() is a handy helper utility, you don't have to use it; feel free to write your own root reducer!\nThe Redux store saves the complete state tree returned by the root reducer.This new tree is now the next state of your app! Every listener registered with store.subscribe(listener) will now be invoked; listeners may call store.getState() to get the current state.Now, the UI can be updated to reflect the new state. If you use bindings like React Redux, this is the point at which component.setState(newState) is called.\nNext StepsNow that you know how Redux works, let's connect it to a React app.Note for Advanced UsersIf you're already familiar with the basic concepts and have previously completed this tutorial, don't forget to check out async flow in the advanced tutorial to learn how middleware transforms async actions before they reach the reducer."},"docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html":{"url":"docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html","title":"Usage with React","keywords":"","body":"Usage with ReactFrom the very beginning, we need to stress that Redux has no relation to React. You can write Redux apps with React, Angular, Ember, jQuery, or vanilla JavaScript.That said, Redux works especially well with libraries like React and Deku because they let you describe UI as a function of state, and Redux emits state updates in response to actions.We will use React to build our simple todo app.Installing React ReduxReact bindings are not included in Redux by default. You need to install them explicitly:npm install --save react-redux\nIf you don't use npm, you may grab the latest UMD build from unpkg (either a development or a production build). The UMD build exports a global called window.ReactRedux if you add it to your page via a  tag.Presentational and Container ComponentsReact bindings for Redux embrace the idea of separating presentational and container components. If you're not familiar with these terms, read about them first, and then come back. They are important, so we'll wait!Finished reading the article? Let's recount their differences:\n    \n        \n            \n            Presentational Components\n            Container Components\n        \n    \n    \n        \n          Purpose\n          How things look (markup, styles)\n          How things work (data fetching, state updates)\n        \n        \n          Aware of Redux\n          No\n          Yes\n        \n        \n          To read data\n          Read data from props\n          Subscribe to Redux state\n        \n        \n          To change data\n          Invoke callbacks from props\n          Dispatch Redux actions\n        \n        \n          Are written\n          By hand\n          Usually generated by React Redux\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nMost of the components we'll write will be presentational, but we'll need to generate a few container components to connect them to the Redux store.Technically you could write the container components by hand using store.subscribe(). We don't advise you to do this because React Redux makes many performance optimizations that are hard to do by hand. For this reason, rather than write container components, we will generate them using the connect() function provided by React Redux, as you will see below.Designing Component HierarchyRemember how we designed the shape of the root state object? It's time we design the UI hierarchy to match it. This is not a Redux-specific task. Thinking in React is a great tutorial that explains the process.Our design brief is simple. We want to show a list of todo items. On click, a todo item is crossed out as completed. We want to show a field where the user may add a new todo. In the footer, we want to show a toggle to show all, only completed, or only active todos.Presentational ComponentsI see the following presentational components and their props emerge from this brief:TodoList is a list showing visible todos.todos: Array is an array of todo items with { id, text, completed } shape.\n\nonTodoClick(id: number) is a callback to invoke when a todo is clicked.\n\n\nTodo is a single todo item.text: string is the text to show.\n\ncompleted: boolean is whether todo should appear crossed out.\n\nonClick() is a callback to invoke when a todo is clicked.\n\n\nLink is a link with a callback.onClick() is a callback to invoke when link is clicked.\n\n\nFooter is where we let the user change currently visible todos.\nApp is the root component that renders everything else.\n\nThey describe the look but don't know where the data comes from, or how to change it. They only render what's given to them. If you migrate from Redux to something else, you'll be able to keep all these components exactly the same. They have no dependency on Redux.Container ComponentsWe will also need some container components to connect the presentational components to Redux. For example, the presentational TodoList component needs a container like VisibleTodoList that subscribes to the Redux store and knows how to apply the current visibility filter. To change the visibility filter, we will provide a FilterLink container component that renders a Link that dispatches an appropriate action on click:VisibleTodoList filters the todos according to the current visibility filter and renders a TodoList.\n\nFilterLink gets the current visibility filter and renders a Link.\nfilter: string is the visibility filter it represents.\n\n\nOther ComponentsSometimes it's hard to tell if some component should be a presentational component or a container. For example, sometimes form and function are really coupled together, such as in case of this tiny component:AddTodo is an input field with an “Add” button\n\nTechnically we could split it into two components but it might be too early at this stage. It's fine to mix presentation and logic in a component that is very small. As it grows, it will be more obvious how to split it, so we'll leave it mixed.Implementing ComponentsLet's write the components! We begin with the presentational components so we don't need to think about binding to Redux yet.Presentational ComponentsThese are all normal React components, so we won't examine them in detail. We write functional stateless components unless we need to use local state or the lifecycle methods. This doesn't mean that presentational components have to be functions—it's just easier to define them this way. If and when you need to add local state, lifecycle methods, or performance optimizations, you can convert them to classes.components/Todo.jsimport React, { PropTypes } from 'react'\n\nconst Todo = ({ onClick, completed, text }) => (\n  \n    {text}\n  \n)\n\nTodo.propTypes = {\n  onClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n  completed: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,\n  text: PropTypes.string.isRequired\n}\n\nexport default Todo\ncomponents/TodoList.jsimport React, { PropTypes } from 'react'\nimport Todo from './Todo'\n\nconst TodoList = ({ todos, onTodoClick }) => (\n  \n    {todos.map(todo =>\n       onTodoClick(todo.id)}\n      />\n    )}\n  \n)\n\nTodoList.propTypes = {\n  todos: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({\n    id: PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n    completed: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,\n    text: PropTypes.string.isRequired\n  }).isRequired).isRequired,\n  onTodoClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired\n}\n\nexport default TodoList\ncomponents/Link.jsimport React, { PropTypes } from 'react'\n\nconst Link = ({ active, children, onClick }) => {\n  if (active) {\n    return {children}\n  }\n\n  return (\n     {\n         e.preventDefault()\n         onClick()\n       }}\n    >\n      {children}\n    \n  )\n}\n\nLink.propTypes = {\n  active: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,\n  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,\n  onClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired\n}\n\nexport default Link\ncomponents/Footer.jsimport React from 'react'\nimport FilterLink from '../containers/FilterLink'\n\nconst Footer = () => (\n  \n    Show:\n    {\" \"}\n    \n      All\n    \n    {\", \"}\n    \n      Active\n    \n    {\", \"}\n    \n      Completed\n    \n  \n)\n\nexport default Footer\ncomponents/App.jsimport React from 'react'\nimport Footer from './Footer'\nimport AddTodo from '../containers/AddTodo'\nimport VisibleTodoList from '../containers/VisibleTodoList'\n\nconst App = () => (\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n)\n\nexport default App\nContainer ComponentsNow it's time to hook up those presentational components to Redux by creating some containers. Technically, a container component is just a React component that uses store.subscribe() to read a part of the Redux state tree and supply props to a presentational component it renders. You could write a container component by hand, but we suggest instead generating container components with the React Redux library's connect() function, which provides many useful optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders. (One result of this is that you shouldn't have to worry about the React performance suggestion of implementing shouldComponentUpdate yourself.)To use connect(), you need to define a special function called mapStateToProps that tells how to transform the current Redux store state into the props you want to pass to a presentational component you are wrapping. For example, VisibleTodoList needs to calculate todos to pass to the TodoList, so we define a function that filters the state.todos according to the state.visibilityFilter, and use it in its mapStateToProps:const getVisibleTodos = (todos, filter) => {\n  switch (filter) {\n    case 'SHOW_ALL':\n      return todos\n    case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n      return todos.filter(t => t.completed)\n    case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n      return todos.filter(t => !t.completed)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)\n  }\n}\nIn addition to reading the state, container components can dispatch actions. In a similar fashion, you can define a function called mapDispatchToProps() that receives the dispatch() method and returns callback props that you want to inject into the presentational component. For example, we want the VisibleTodoList to inject a prop called onTodoClick into the TodoList component, and we want onTodoClick to dispatch a TOGGLE_TODO action:const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: (id) => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\nFinally, we create the VisibleTodoList by calling connect() and passing these two functions:import { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\nThese are the basics of the React Redux API, but there are a few shortcuts and power options so we encourage you to check out its documentation in detail.

One option would be to pass it as a prop to every container component. However it gets tedious, as you have to wire store even through presentational components just because they happen to render a container deep in the component tree.The option we recommend is to use a special React Redux component called  to magically make the store available to all container components in the application without passing it explicitly. You only need to use it once when you render the root component:index.jsimport React from 'react'\nimport { render } from 'react-dom'\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport todoApp from './reducers'\nimport App from './components/App'\n\nlet store = createStore(todoApp)\n\nrender(\n  \n    \n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\nNext StepsRead the complete source code for this tutorial to better internalize the knowledge you have gained.

It was fully synchronous. Every time an action was dispatched, the state was updated immediately.In this guide, we will build a different, asynchronous application. It will use the Reddit API to show the current headlines for a selected subreddit. How does asynchronicity fit into Redux flow?ActionsWhen you call an asynchronous API, there are two crucial moments in time: the moment you start the call, and the moment when you receive an answer (or a timeout).Each of these two moments usually require a change in the application state; to do that, you need to dispatch normal actions that will be processed by reducers synchronously. Usually, for any API request you'll want to dispatch at least three different kinds of actions:An action informing the reducers that the request began.The reducers may handle this action by toggling an isFetching flag in the state. This way the UI knows it's time to show a spinner.\nAn action informing the reducers that the request finished successfully.The reducers may handle this action by merging the new data into the state they manage and resetting isFetching. The UI would hide the spinner, and display the fetched data.\nAn action informing the reducers that the request failed.The reducers may handle this action by resetting isFetching. Additionally, some reducers may want to store the error message so the UI can display it.\nYou may use a dedicated status field in your actions:{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS' }\n{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS', status: 'error', error: 'Oops' }\n{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS', status: 'success', response: { ... } }\nOr you can define separate types for them:{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_REQUEST' }\n{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_FAILURE', error: 'Oops' }\n{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_SUCCESS', response: { ... } }\nChoosing whether to use a single action type with flags, or multiple action types, is up to you. It's a convention you need to decide with your team. Multiple types leave less room for a mistake, but this is not an issue if you generate action creators and reducers with a helper library like redux-actions.Whatever convention you choose, stick with it throughout the application.We'll use separate types in this tutorial.Synchronous Action CreatorsLet's start by defining the several synchronous action types and action creators we need in our example app. Here, the user can select a subreddit to display:actions.jsexport const SELECT_SUBREDDIT = 'SELECT_SUBREDDIT'\n\nexport function selectSubreddit(subreddit) {\n  return {\n    type: SELECT_SUBREDDIT,\n    subreddit\n  }\n}\nThey can also press a “refresh” button to update it:export const INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT = 'INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT'\n\nexport function invalidateSubreddit(subreddit) {\n  return {\n    type: INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT,\n    subreddit\n  }\n}\nThese were the actions governed by the user interaction. We will also have another kind of action, governed by the network requests. We will see how to dispatch them later, but for now, we just want to define them.When it's time to fetch the posts for some subreddit, we will dispatch a REQUEST_POSTS action:export const REQUEST_POSTS = 'REQUEST_POSTS'\n\nexport function requestPosts(subreddit) {\n  return {\n    type: REQUEST_POSTS,\n    subreddit\n  }\n}\nIt is important for it to be separate from SELECT_SUBREDDIT or INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT. While they may occur one after another, as the app grows more complex, you might want to fetch some data independently of the user action (for example, to prefetch the most popular subreddits, or to refresh stale data once in a while). You may also want to fetch in response to a route change, so it's not wise to couple fetching to some particular UI event early on.Finally, when the network request comes through, we will dispatch RECEIVE_POSTS:export const RECEIVE_POSTS = 'RECEIVE_POSTS'\n\nexport function receivePosts(subreddit, json) {\n  return {\n    type: RECEIVE_POSTS,\n    subreddit,\n    posts: json.data.children.map(child => child.data),\n    receivedAt: Date.now()\n  }\n}\nThis is all we need to know for now. The particular mechanism to dispatch these actions together with network requests will be discussed later.Note on Error HandlingIn a real app, you'd also want to dispatch an action on request failure. We won't implement error handling in this tutorial, but the real world example shows one of the possible approaches.Designing the State ShapeJust like in the basic tutorial, you'll need to design the shape of your application's state before rushing into the implementation. With asynchronous code, there is more state to take care of, so we need to think it through.This part is often confusing to beginners, because it is not immediately clear what information describes the state of an asynchronous application, and how to organize it in a single tree.We'll start with the most common use case: lists. Web applications often show lists of things. For example, a list of posts, or a list of friends. You'll need to figure out what sorts of lists your app can show. You want to store them separately in the state, because this way you can cache them and only fetch again if necessary.Here's what the state shape for our “Reddit headlines” app might look like:{\n  selectedSubreddit: 'frontend',\n  postsBySubreddit: {\n    frontend: {\n      isFetching: true,\n      didInvalidate: false,\n      items: []\n    },\n    reactjs: {\n      isFetching: false,\n      didInvalidate: false,\n      lastUpdated: 1439478405547,\n      items: [\n        {\n          id: 42,\n          title: 'Confusion about Flux and Relay'\n        },\n        {\n          id: 500,\n          title: 'Creating a Simple Application Using React JS and Flux Architecture'\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nThere are a few important bits here:We store each subreddit's information separately so we can cache every subreddit. When the user switches between them the second time, the update will be instant, and we won't need to refetch unless we want to. Don't worry about all these items being in memory: unless you're dealing with tens of thousands of items, and your user rarely closes the tab, you won't need any sort of cleanup.\nFor every list of items, you'll want to store isFetching to show a spinner, didInvalidate so you can later toggle it when the data is stale, lastUpdated so you know when it was fetched the last time, and the items themselves. In a real app, you'll also want to store pagination state like fetchedPageCount and nextPageUrl.\nNote on Nested EntitiesIn this example, we store the received items together with the pagination information. However, this approach won't work well if you have nested entities referencing each other, or if you let the user edit items. Imagine the user wants to edit a fetched post, but this post is duplicated in several places in the state tree. This would be really painful to implement.If you have nested entities, or if you let users edit received entities, you should keep them separately in the state as if it was a database. In pagination information, you would only refer to them by their IDs. This lets you always keep them up to date. The real world example shows this approach, together with normalizr to normalize the nested API responses. With this approach, your state might look like this:{\n  selectedSubreddit: 'frontend',\n  entities: {\n    users: {\n      2: {\n        id: 2,\n        name: 'Andrew'\n      }\n    },\n    posts: {\n      42: {\n        id: 42,\n        title: 'Confusion about Flux and Relay',\n        author: 2\n      },\n      100: {\n        id: 100,\n        title: 'Creating a Simple Application Using React JS and Flux Architecture',\n        author: 2\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  postsBySubreddit: {\n    frontend: {\n      isFetching: true,\n      didInvalidate: false,\n      items: []\n    },\n    reactjs: {\n      isFetching: false,\n      didInvalidate: false,\n      lastUpdated: 1439478405547,\n      items: [ 42, 100 ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nIn this guide, we won't normalize entities, but it's something you should consider for a more dynamic application.Handling ActionsBefore going into the details of dispatching actions together with network requests, we will write the reducers for the actions we defined above.Note on Reducer CompositionHere, we assume that you understand reducer composition with combineReducers(), as described in the Splitting Reducers section on the basics guide. If you don't, please read it first.reducers.jsimport { combineReducers } from 'redux'\nimport {\n  SELECT_SUBREDDIT, INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT,\n  REQUEST_POSTS, RECEIVE_POSTS\n} from '../actions'\n\nfunction selectedSubreddit(state = 'reactjs', action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SELECT_SUBREDDIT:\n      return action.subreddit\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction posts(state = {\n  isFetching: false,\n  didInvalidate: false,\n  items: []\n}, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        didInvalidate: true\n      })\n    case REQUEST_POSTS:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        isFetching: true,\n        didInvalidate: false\n      })\n    case RECEIVE_POSTS:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        isFetching: false,\n        didInvalidate: false,\n        items: action.posts,\n        lastUpdated: action.receivedAt\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction postsBySubreddit(state = {}, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT:\n    case RECEIVE_POSTS:\n    case REQUEST_POSTS:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        [action.subreddit]: posts(state[action.subreddit], action)\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n  postsBySubreddit,\n  selectedSubreddit\n})\n\nexport default rootReducer\nIn this code, there are two interesting parts:We use ES6 computed property syntax so we can update state[action.subreddit] with Object.assign() in a terse way. This:return Object.assign({}, state, {\n  [action.subreddit]: posts(state[action.subreddit], action)\n})\nis equivalent to this:let nextState = {}\nnextState[action.subreddit] = posts(state[action.subreddit], action)\nreturn Object.assign({}, state, nextState)\nWe extracted posts(state, action) that manages the state of a specific post list. This is just reducer composition! It is our choice how to split the reducer into smaller reducers, and in this case, we're delegating updating items inside an object to a posts reducer. The real world example goes even further, showing how to create a reducer factory for parameterized pagination reducers.\n\n\nRemember that reducers are just functions, so you can use functional composition and higher-order functions as much as you feel comfortable.Async Action CreatorsFinally, how do we use the synchronous action creators we defined earlier together with network requests? The standard way to do it with Redux is to use the Redux Thunk middleware. It comes in a separate package called redux-thunk. We'll explain how middleware works in general later; for now, there is just one important thing you need to know: by using this specific middleware, an action creator can return a function instead of an action object. This way, the action creator becomes a thunk.When an action creator returns a function, that function will get executed by the Redux Thunk middleware. This function doesn't need to be pure; it is thus allowed to have side effects, including executing asynchronous API calls. The function can also dispatch actions—like those synchronous actions we defined earlier.We can still define these special thunk action creators inside our actions.js file:actions.jsimport fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch'\n\nexport const REQUEST_POSTS = 'REQUEST_POSTS'\nfunction requestPosts(subreddit) {\n  return {\n    type: REQUEST_POSTS,\n    subreddit\n  }\n}\n\nexport const RECEIVE_POSTS = 'RECEIVE_POSTS'\nfunction receivePosts(subreddit, json) {\n  return {\n    type: RECEIVE_POSTS,\n    subreddit,\n    posts: json.data.children.map(child => child.data),\n    receivedAt: Date.now()\n  }\n}\n\n// Meet our first thunk action creator!\n// Though its insides are different, you would use it just like any other action creator:\n// store.dispatch(fetchPosts('reactjs'))\n\nexport function fetchPosts(subreddit) {\n\n  // Thunk middleware knows how to handle functions.\n  // It passes the dispatch method as an argument to the function,\n  // thus making it able to dispatch actions itself.\n\n  return function (dispatch) {\n\n    // First dispatch: the app state is updated to inform\n    // that the API call is starting.\n\n    dispatch(requestPosts(subreddit))\n\n    // The function called by the thunk middleware can return a value,\n    // that is passed on as the return value of the dispatch method.\n\n    // In this case, we return a promise to wait for.\n    // This is not required by thunk middleware, but it is convenient for us.\n\n    return fetch(`http://www.reddit.com/r/${subreddit}.json`)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(json =>\n\n        // We can dispatch many times!\n        // Here, we update the app state with the results of the API call.\n\n        dispatch(receivePosts(subreddit, json))\n      )\n\n      // In a real world app, you also want to\n      // catch any error in the network call.\n  }\n}\nNote on fetchWe use fetch API in the examples. It is a new API for making network requests that replaces XMLHttpRequest for most common needs. Because most browsers don't yet support it natively, we suggest that you use isomorphic-fetch library:// Do this in every file where you use `fetch`\nimport fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch'\nInternally, it uses whatwg-fetch polyfill on the client, and node-fetch on the server, so you won't need to change API calls if you change your app to be universal.Be aware that any fetch polyfill assumes a Promise polyfill is already present. The easiest way to ensure you have a Promise polyfill is to enable Babel's ES6 polyfill in your entry point before any other code runs:// Do this once before any other code in your app\nimport 'babel-polyfill'\nHow do we include the Redux Thunk middleware in the dispatch mechanism? We use the applyMiddleware() store enhancer from Redux, as shown below:index.jsimport thunkMiddleware from 'redux-thunk'\nimport createLogger from 'redux-logger'\nimport { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport { selectSubreddit, fetchPosts } from './actions'\nimport rootReducer from './reducers'\n\nconst loggerMiddleware = createLogger()\n\nconst store = createStore(\n  rootReducer,\n  applyMiddleware(\n    thunkMiddleware, // lets us dispatch() functions\n    loggerMiddleware // neat middleware that logs actions\n  )\n)\n\nstore.dispatch(selectSubreddit('reactjs'))\nstore.dispatch(fetchPosts('reactjs')).then(() =>\n  console.log(store.getState())\n)\nThe nice thing about thunks is that they can dispatch results of each other:actions.jsimport fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch'\n\nexport const REQUEST_POSTS = 'REQUEST_POSTS'\nfunction requestPosts(subreddit) {\n  return {\n    type: REQUEST_POSTS,\n    subreddit\n  }\n}\n\nexport const RECEIVE_POSTS = 'RECEIVE_POSTS'\nfunction receivePosts(subreddit, json) {\n  return {\n    type: RECEIVE_POSTS,\n    subreddit,\n    posts: json.data.children.map(child => child.data),\n    receivedAt: Date.now()\n  }\n}\n\nfunction fetchPosts(subreddit) {\n  return dispatch => {\n    dispatch(requestPosts(subreddit))\n    return fetch(`http://www.reddit.com/r/${subreddit}.json`)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(json => dispatch(receivePosts(subreddit, json)))\n  }\n}\n\nfunction shouldFetchPosts(state, subreddit) {\n  const posts = state.postsBySubreddit[subreddit]\n  if (!posts) {\n    return true\n  } else if (posts.isFetching) {\n    return false\n  } else {\n    return posts.didInvalidate\n  }\n}\n\nexport function fetchPostsIfNeeded(subreddit) {\n\n  // Note that the function also receives getState()\n  // which lets you choose what to dispatch next.\n\n  // This is useful for avoiding a network request if\n  // a cached value is already available.\n\n  return (dispatch, getState) => {\n    if (shouldFetchPosts(getState(), subreddit)) {\n      // Dispatch a thunk from thunk!\n      return dispatch(fetchPosts(subreddit))\n    } else {\n      // Let the calling code know there's nothing to wait for.\n      return Promise.resolve()\n    }\n  }\n}\nThis lets us write more sophisticated async control flow gradually, while the consuming code can stay pretty much the same:index.jsstore.dispatch(fetchPostsIfNeeded('reactjs')).then(() =>\n  console.log(store.getState())\n)\nNote about Server RenderingAsync action creators are especially convenient for server rendering. You can create a store, dispatch a single async action creator that dispatches other async action creators to fetch data for a whole section of your app, and only render after the Promise it returns, completes. Then your store will already be hydrated with the state you need before rendering.Thunk middleware isn't the only way to orchestrate asynchronous actions in Redux:You can use redux-promise or redux-promise-middleware to dispatch Promises instead of functions.\n\nYou can use redux-observable to dispatch Observables.\n\nYou can use the redux-saga middleware to build more complex asynchronous actions.\n\nYou can even write a custom middleware to describe calls to your API, like the real world example does.\n\nIt is up to you to try a few options, choose a convention you like, and follow it, whether with, or without the middleware.Connecting to UIDispatching async actions is no different from dispatching synchronous actions, so we won't discuss this in detail. See Usage with React for an introduction into using Redux from React components. See Example: Reddit API for the complete source code discussed in this example.Next StepsRead Async Flow to recap how async actions fit into the Redux flow."},"docs/advanced/AsyncFlow.html":{"url":"docs/advanced/AsyncFlow.html","title":"Async Flow","keywords":"","body":"Async FlowWithout middleware, Redux store only supports synchronous data flow. This is what you get by default with createStore().You may enhance createStore() with applyMiddleware(). It is not required, but it lets you express asynchronous actions in a convenient way.Asynchronous middleware like redux-thunk or redux-promise wraps the store's dispatch() method and allows you to dispatch something other than actions, for example, functions or Promises. Any middleware you use can then interpret anything you dispatch, and in turn, can pass actions to the next middleware in the chain. For example, a Promise middleware can intercept Promises and dispatch a pair of begin/end actions asynchronously in response to each Promise.When the last middleware in the chain dispatches an action, it has to be a plain object. This is when the synchronous Redux data flow takes place.Check out the full source code for the async example.Next StepsNow you saw an example of what middleware can do in Redux, it's time to learn how it actually works, and how you can create your own. Go on to the next detailed section about Middleware."},"docs/advanced/Middleware.html":{"url":"docs/advanced/Middleware.html","title":"Middleware","keywords":"","body":"MiddlewareYou've seen middleware in action in the Async Actions example. If you've used server-side libraries like Express and Koa, you were also probably already familiar with the concept of middleware. In these frameworks, middleware is some code you can put between the framework receiving a request, and the framework generating a response. For example, Express or Koa middleware may add CORS headers, logging, compression, and more. The best feature of middleware is that it's composable in a chain. You can use multiple independent third-party middleware in a single project.Redux middleware solves different problems than Express or Koa middleware, but in a conceptually similar way. It provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more.This article is divided into an in-depth intro to help you grok the concept, and a few practical examples to show the power of middleware at the very end. You may find it helpful to switch back and forth between them, as you flip between feeling bored and inspired.Understanding MiddlewareWhile middleware can be used for a variety of things, including asynchronous API calls, it's really important that you understand where it comes from. We'll guide you through the thought process leading to middleware, by using logging and crash reporting as examples.Problem: LoggingOne of the benefits of Redux is that it makes state changes predictable and transparent. Every time an action is dispatched, the new state is computed and saved. The state cannot change by itself, it can only change as a consequence of a specific action.Wouldn't it be nice if we logged every action that happens in the app, together with the state computed after it? When something goes wrong, we can look back at our log, and figure out which action corrupted the state.How do we approach this with Redux?Attempt #1: Logging ManuallyThe most naïve solution is just to log the action and the next state yourself every time you call store.dispatch(action). It's not really a solution, but just a first step towards understanding the problem.NoteIf you're using react-redux or similar bindings, you likely won't have direct access to the store instance in your components. For the next few paragraphs, just assume you pass the store down explicitly.Say, you call this when creating a todo:store.dispatch(addTodo('Use Redux'))\nTo log the action and state, you can change it to something like this:let action = addTodo('Use Redux')\n\nconsole.log('dispatching', action)\nstore.dispatch(action)\nconsole.log('next state', store.getState())\nThis produces the desired effect, but you wouldn't want to do it every time.Attempt #2: Wrapping DispatchYou can extract logging into a function:function dispatchAndLog(store, action) {\n  console.log('dispatching', action)\n  store.dispatch(action)\n  console.log('next state', store.getState())\n}\nYou can then use it everywhere instead of store.dispatch():dispatchAndLog(store, addTodo('Use Redux'))\nWe could end this here, but it's not very convenient to import a special function every time.Attempt #3: Monkeypatching DispatchWhat if we just replace the dispatch function on the store instance? The Redux store is just a plain object with a few methods, and we're writing JavaScript, so we can just monkeypatch the dispatch implementation:let next = store.dispatch\nstore.dispatch = function dispatchAndLog(action) {\n  console.log('dispatching', action)\n  let result = next(action)\n  console.log('next state', store.getState())\n  return result\n}\nThis is already closer to what we want!  No matter where we dispatch an action, it is guaranteed to be logged. Monkeypatching never feels right, but we can live with this for now.Problem: Crash ReportingWhat if we want to apply more than one such transformation to dispatch?A different useful transformation that comes to my mind is reporting JavaScript errors in production. The global window.onerror event is not reliable because it doesn't provide stack information in some older browsers, which is crucial to understand why an error is happening.Wouldn't it be useful if, any time an error is thrown as a result of dispatching an action, we would send it to a crash reporting service like Sentry with the stack trace, the action that caused the error, and the current state? This way it's much easier to reproduce the error in development.However, it is important that we keep logging and crash reporting separate. Ideally we want them to be different modules, potentially in different packages. Otherwise we can't have an ecosystem of such utilities. (Hint: we're slowly getting to what middleware is!)If logging and crash reporting are separate utilities, they might look like this:function patchStoreToAddLogging(store) {\n  let next = store.dispatch\n  store.dispatch = function dispatchAndLog(action) {\n    console.log('dispatching', action)\n    let result = next(action)\n    console.log('next state', store.getState())\n    return result\n  }\n}\n\nfunction patchStoreToAddCrashReporting(store) {\n  let next = store.dispatch\n  store.dispatch = function dispatchAndReportErrors(action) {\n    try {\n      return next(action)\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error('Caught an exception!', err)\n      Raven.captureException(err, {\n        extra: {\n          action,\n          state: store.getState()\n        }\n      })\n      throw err\n    }\n  }\n}\nIf these functions are published as separate modules, we can later use them to patch our store:patchStoreToAddLogging(store)\npatchStoreToAddCrashReporting(store)\nStill, this isn't nice.Attempt #4: Hiding MonkeypatchingMonkeypatching is a hack. “Replace any method you like”, what kind of API is that? Let's figure out the essence of it instead. Previously, our functions replaced store.dispatch. What if they returned the new dispatch function instead?function logger(store) {\n  let next = store.dispatch\n\n  // Previously:\n  // store.dispatch = function dispatchAndLog(action) {\n\n  return function dispatchAndLog(action) {\n    console.log('dispatching', action)\n    let result = next(action)\n    console.log('next state', store.getState())\n    return result\n  }\n}\nWe could provide a helper inside Redux that would apply the actual monkeypatching as an implementation detail:function applyMiddlewareByMonkeypatching(store, middlewares) {\n  middlewares = middlewares.slice()\n  middlewares.reverse()\n\n  // Transform dispatch function with each middleware.\n  middlewares.forEach(middleware =>\n    store.dispatch = middleware(store)\n  )\n}\nWe could use it to apply multiple middleware like this:applyMiddlewareByMonkeypatching(store, [ logger, crashReporter ])\nHowever, it is still monkeypatching.The fact that we hide it inside the library doesn't alter this fact.Attempt #5: Removing MonkeypatchingWhy do we even overwrite dispatch? Of course, to be able to call it later, but there's also another reason: so that every middleware can access (and call) the previously wrapped store.dispatch:function logger(store) {\n  // Must point to the function returned by the previous middleware:\n  let next = store.dispatch\n\n  return function dispatchAndLog(action) {\n    console.log('dispatching', action)\n    let result = next(action)\n    console.log('next state', store.getState())\n    return result\n  }\n}\nIt is essential to chaining middleware!If applyMiddlewareByMonkeypatching doesn't assign store.dispatch immediately after processing the first middleware, store.dispatch will keep pointing to the original dispatch function. Then the second middleware will also be bound to the original dispatch function.But there's also a different way to enable chaining. The middleware could accept the next() dispatch function as a parameter instead of reading it from the store instance.function logger(store) {\n  return function wrapDispatchToAddLogging(next) {\n    return function dispatchAndLog(action) {\n      console.log('dispatching', action)\n      let result = next(action)\n      console.log('next state', store.getState())\n      return result\n    }\n  }\n}\nIt's a “we need to go deeper” kind of moment, so it might take a while for this to make sense. The function cascade feels intimidating. ES6 arrow functions make this currying easier on eyes:const logger = store => next => action => {\n  console.log('dispatching', action)\n  let result = next(action)\n  console.log('next state', store.getState())\n  return result\n}\n\nconst crashReporter = store => next => action => {\n  try {\n    return next(action)\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Caught an exception!', err)\n    Raven.captureException(err, {\n      extra: {\n        action,\n        state: store.getState()\n      }\n    })\n    throw err\n  }\n}\nThis is exactly what Redux middleware looks like.Now middleware takes the next() dispatch function, and returns a dispatch function, which in turn serves as next() to the middleware to the left, and so on. It's still useful to have access to some store methods like getState(), so store stays available as the top-level argument.Attempt #6: Naïvely Applying the MiddlewareInstead of applyMiddlewareByMonkeypatching(), we could write applyMiddleware() that first obtains the final, fully wrapped dispatch() function, and returns a copy of the store using it:// Warning: Naïve implementation!\n// That's *not* Redux API.\n\nfunction applyMiddleware(store, middlewares) {\n  middlewares = middlewares.slice()\n  middlewares.reverse()\n\n  let dispatch = store.dispatch\n  middlewares.forEach(middleware =>\n    dispatch = middleware(store)(dispatch)\n  )\n\n  return Object.assign({}, store, { dispatch })\n}\nThe implementation of applyMiddleware() that ships with Redux is similar, but different in three important aspects:It only exposes a subset of the store API to the middleware: dispatch(action) and getState().\nIt does a bit of trickery to make sure that if you call store.dispatch(action) from your middleware instead of next(action), the action will actually travel the whole middleware chain again, including the current middleware. This is useful for asynchronous middleware, as we have seen previously.\nTo ensure that you may only apply middleware once, it operates on createStore() rather than on store itself. Instead of (store, middlewares) => store, its signature is (...middlewares) => (createStore) => createStore.\nBecause it is cumbersome to apply functions to createStore() before using it, createStore() accepts an optional last argument to specify such functions.The Final ApproachGiven this middleware we just wrote:const logger = store => next => action => {\n  console.log('dispatching', action)\n  let result = next(action)\n  console.log('next state', store.getState())\n  return result\n}\n\nconst crashReporter = store => next => action => {\n  try {\n    return next(action)\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Caught an exception!', err)\n    Raven.captureException(err, {\n      extra: {\n        action,\n        state: store.getState()\n      }\n    })\n    throw err\n  }\n}\nHere's how to apply it to a Redux store:import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\n\nlet todoApp = combineReducers(reducers)\nlet store = createStore(\n  todoApp,\n  // applyMiddleware() tells createStore() how to handle middleware\n  applyMiddleware(logger, crashReporter)\n)\nThat's it! Now any actions dispatched to the store instance will flow through logger and crashReporter:// Will flow through both logger and crashReporter middleware!\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('Use Redux'))\nSeven ExamplesIf your head boiled from reading the above section, imagine what it was like to write it.

Redux will be the source of truth for your data and React Router will be the source of truth for your URL. In most of the cases, it is fine to have them separate unless if you need to time travel and rewind actions that triggers the change URL.Installing React Routerreact-router is available on npm . This guides assumes you are using react-router@^2.7.0.npm install --save react-routerConfiguring the Fallback URLBefore integrating React Router, we need to configure our development server. Indeed, our development server may be unaware of the declared routes in React Router configuration. For example, if you access /todos and refresh, your development server needs to be instructed to serve index.html because it is a single-page app. Here's how to enable this with popular development severs.Note on Create React AppIf you are using Create React App, you won't need to configure a fallback URL, it is automatically done.Configuring ExpressIf you are serving your index.html from Express:  app.get('/*', (req,res) => {\n    res.sendfile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'))\n  })\nConfiguring WebpackDevServerIf you are serving your index.html from WebpackDevServer:\nYou can add to your webpack.config.dev.js:  devServer: {\n    historyApiFallback: true,\n  }\nConnecting React Router with Redux AppAlong this chapter, we will be using the Todos example. We recommend you to clone it while reading this chapter.First we will need to import  and  from React Router. Here's how to do it:import { Router, Route, browserHistory } from 'react-router';\nIn a React app, usually you would wrap  in  so that when the URL changes,  will match a branch of its routes, and render their configured components.  is used to declaratively map routes to your application's component hierarchy. You would declare in path the path used in the URL and in component the single component to be rendered when the route matches the URL.const Root = () => (\n  \n    \n    \n);\nHowever, in our Redux App we will still need .  is the higher-order component provided by React Redux that lets you bind Redux to React (see Usage with React).We will then import the  from React Redux:import { Provider } from 'react-redux';\nWe will wrap  in  so that route handlers can get access to the store.const Root = ({ store }) => (\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n);\nNow  component will be rendered if the URL match '/'. Additionally, we will add the optional (:filter) parameter to /, we will need it further below when we will try to read the parameter (:filter) from the URL.\nYou will probably want to remove the hash from URL (e.g: http://localhost:3000/#/?_k=4sbb0i). For doing this, you will need to also import browserHistory from React Router:import { Router, Route, browserHistory } from 'react-router';\nand pass it to the  in order to remove the hash from the URL:    \n      \n    \nUnless you are targeting old browsers like IE9, you can always use browserHistory.components/Root.jsimport React, { PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux';\nimport { Router, Route, browserHistory } from 'react-router';\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst Root = ({ store }) => (\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n);\n\nRoot.propTypes = {\n  store: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n};\n\nexport default Root;\nNavigating with React RouterReact Router comes with a  component that let you navigate around your application. We can use it in our example and change our container  component so we can change the URL using . The activeStyle={} property lets you apply a style on the active state.containers/FilterLink.jsimport React from 'react';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router';\n\nconst FilterLink = ({ filter, children }) => (\n  \n    {children}\n  \n);\n\nexport default FilterLink;\ncontainers/Footer.jsimport React from 'react'\nimport FilterLink from '../containers/FilterLink'\n\nconst Footer = () => (\n  \n    Show:\n    {\" \"}\n    \n      All\n    \n    {\", \"}\n    \n      Active\n    \n    {\", \"}\n    \n      Completed\n    \n  \n);\n\nexport default Footer\nNow if you click on  you will see that your URL will change from '/complete', '/active', '/'. Even if you are going back with your browser, it will use your browser's history and effectively go to your previous URL.Reading From the URLCurrently, the todo list is not filtered even after the URL changed. This is because we are filtering from 's mapStateToProps() is still binded to the state and not to the URL. mapStateToProps has an optional second argument ownProps that is an object with every props passed to containers/VisibleTodoList.jsconst mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, ownProps.filter) // previously was getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)\n  };\n};\nRight now we are not passing anything to  so ownProps is an empty object. To filter our todos according to the URL, we want to pass the URL params to .When previously we wrote:  , it made available inside App a params property.params property is an object with every param specified in the url. e.g: params will be equal to { filter: 'completed' } if we are navigating to localhost:3000/completed. We can now read the URL from .Note that we are using ES6 destructuring on the properties to pass in params to .components/App.jsconst App = ({ params }) => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  );\n};\nNext StepsNow that you know how to do basic routing, you can learn more about React Router APINote About Other Routing LibrariesRedux Router is an experimental library, it lets you keep entirely the state of your URL inside your redux store. It has the same API with React Router API but has a smaller community support than react-router.React Router Redux creates binding between your redux app and react-router and it keeps them in sync. Without this binding, you will not be able to rewind the actions with Time Travel.

Redux","keywords":"","body":"Migrating to ReduxRedux is not a monolithic framework, but a set of contracts and a few functions that make them work together. The majority of your “Redux code” will not even use Redux APIs, as most of the time you'll be writing functions.This makes it easy to migrate both to and from Redux.We don't want to lock you in!From FluxReducers capture “the essence” of Flux Stores, so it's possible to gradually migrate an existing Flux project towards Redux, whether you are using Flummox, Alt, traditional Flux, or any other Flux library.It is also possible to do the reverse and migrate from Redux to any of these libraries following the same steps.Your process will look like this:Create a function called createFluxStore(reducer) that creates a Flux store compatible with your existing app from a reducer function. Internally it might look similar to createStore (source) implementation from Redux. Its dispatch handler should just call the reducer for any action, store the next state, and emit change.\nThis allows you to gradually rewrite every Flux Store in your app as a reducer, but still export createFluxStore(reducer) so the rest of your app is not aware that this is happening and sees the Flux stores.\nAs you rewrite your Stores, you will find that you need to avoid certain Flux anti-patterns such as fetching API inside the Store, or triggering actions inside the Stores. Your Flux code will be easier to follow once you port it to be based on reducers!\nWhen you have ported all of your Flux Stores to be implemented on top of reducers, you can replace the Flux library with a single Redux store, and combine those reducers you already have into one using combineReducers(reducers).\nNow all that's left to do is to port the UI to use react-redux or equivalent.\nFinally, you might want to begin using some Redux idioms like middleware to further simplify your asynchronous code.\nFrom BackboneBackbone's model layer is quite different from Redux, so we don't suggest mixing them. If possible, it is best that you rewrite your app's model layer from scratch instead of connecting Backbone to Redux. However, if a rewrite is not feasible, you may use backbone-redux to migrate gradually, and keep the Redux store in sync with Backbone models and collections."},"docs/recipes/UsingObjectSpreadOperator.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/UsingObjectSpreadOperator.html","title":"Using Object Spread Operator","keywords":"","body":"Using Object Spread OperatorSince one of the core tenets of Redux is to never mutate state, you'll often find yourself using Object.assign() to create\ncopies of objects with new or updated values. For example, in the todoApp below Object.assign() is used to return a new\nstate object with an updated visibilityFilter property:function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        visibilityFilter: action.filter\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\nWhile effective, using Object.assign() can quickly make simple reducers difficult to read given its rather verbose syntax.An alternative approach is to use the object spread syntax proposed for the next versions of JavaScript which lets you use the spread (...) operator to copy enumerable properties from one object to another in a more succinct way. The object spread operator is conceptually similar to the ES6 array spread operator. We\ncan simplify the todoApp example above by using the object spread syntax:function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return { ...state, visibilityFilter: action.filter }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\nThe advantage of using the object spread syntax becomes more apparent when you're composing complex objects. Below getAddedIds maps an array of id values to an array of objects with values returned from getProduct and getQuantity.return getAddedIds(state.cart).map(id => Object.assign(\n  {},\n  getProduct(state.products, id),\n  {\n    quantity: getQuantity(state.cart, id)\n  }\n))\nObject spread lets us simplify the above map call to:return getAddedIds(state.cart).map(id => ({\n  ...getProduct(state.products, id),\n  quantity: getQuantity(state.cart, id)\n}))\nSince the object spread syntax is still a Stage 2 proposal for ECMAScript you'll need to use a transpiler such as Babel to use it in production. You can use your existing es2015 preset, install babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread and add it individually to the plugins array in your .babelrc.{\n  \"presets\": [\"es2015\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\"transform-object-rest-spread\"]\n}\nNote that this is still an experimental language feature proposal so it may change in the future. Nevertheless some large projects such as React Native already use it extensively so it is safe to say that there will be a good automated migration path if it changes."},"docs/recipes/ReducingBoilerplate.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/ReducingBoilerplate.html","title":"Reducing Boilerplate","keywords":"","body":"Reducing BoilerplateRedux is in part inspired by Flux, and the most common complaint about Flux is how it makes you write a lot of boilerplate. In this recipe, we will consider how Redux lets us choose how verbose we'd like our code to be, depending on personal style, team preferences, longer term maintainability, and so on.ActionsActions are plain objects describing what happened in the app, and serve as the sole way to describe an intention to mutate the data. It's important that actions being objects you have to dispatch is not boilerplate, but one of the fundamental design choices of Redux.There are frameworks claiming to be similar to Flux, but without a concept of action objects. In terms of being predictable, this is a step backwards from Flux or Redux. If there are no serializable plain object actions, it is impossible to record and replay user sessions, or to implement hot reloading with time travel. If you'd rather modify data directly, you don't need Redux.Actions look like this:{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Use Redux' }\n{ type: 'REMOVE_TODO', id: 42 }\n{ type: 'LOAD_ARTICLE', response: { ... } }\nIt is a common convention that actions have a constant type that helps reducers (or Stores in Flux) identify them. We recommend that you use strings and not Symbols for action types, because strings are serializable, and by using Symbols you make recording and replaying harder than it needs to be.In Flux, it is traditionally thought that you would define every action type as a string constant:const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'\nconst REMOVE_TODO = 'REMOVE_TODO'\nconst LOAD_ARTICLE = 'LOAD_ARTICLE'\nWhy is this beneficial? It is often claimed that constants are unnecessary, and for small projects, this might be correct. For larger projects, there are some benefits to defining action types as constants:It helps keep the naming consistent because all action types are gathered in a single place.\n\nSometimes you want to see all existing actions before working on a new feature. It may be that the action you need was already added by somebody on the team, but you didn't know.\n\nThe list of action types that were added, removed, and changed in a Pull Request helps everyone on the team keep track of scope and implementation of new features.\n\nIf you make a typo when importing an action constant, you will get undefined. Redux will immediately throw when dispatching such an action, and you'll find the mistake sooner.\n\nIt is up to you to choose the conventions for your project. You may start by using inline strings, and later transition to constants, and maybe later group them into a single file. Redux does not have any opinion here, so use your best judgment.Action CreatorsIt is another common convention that, instead of creating action objects inline in the places where you dispatch the actions, you would create functions generating them.For example, instead of calling dispatch with an object literal:// somewhere in an event handler\ndispatch({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  text: 'Use Redux'\n})\nYou might write an action creator in a separate file, and import it from your component:actionCreators.jsexport function addTodo(text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    text\n  }\n}\nAddTodo.jsimport { addTodo } from './actionCreators'\n\n// somewhere in an event handler\ndispatch(addTodo('Use Redux'))\nAction creators have often been criticized as boilerplate. Well, you don't have to write them! You can use object literals if you feel this better suits your project. There are, however, some benefits for writing action creators you should know about.Let's say a designer comes back to us after reviewing our prototype, and tells that we need to allow three todos maximum. We can enforce this by rewriting our action creator to a callback form with redux-thunk middleware and adding an early exit:function addTodoWithoutCheck(text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nexport function addTodo(text) {\n  // This form is allowed by Redux Thunk middleware\n  // described below in “Async Action Creators” section.\n  return function (dispatch, getState) {\n    if (getState().todos.length === 3) {\n      // Exit early\n      return\n    }\n\n    dispatch(addTodoWithoutCheck(text))\n  }\n}\nWe just modified how the addTodo action creator behaves, completely invisible to the calling code. We don't have to worry about looking at each place where todos are being added, to make sure they have this check. Action creators let you decouple additional logic around dispatching an action, from the actual components emitting those actions. It's very handy when the application is under heavy development, and the requirements change often.Generating Action CreatorsSome frameworks like Flummox generate action type constants automatically from the action creator function definitions. The idea is that you don't need to both define ADD_TODO constant and addTodo() action creator. Under the hood, such solutions still generate action type constants, but they're created implicitly so it's a level of indirection and can cause confusion. We recommend creating your action type constants explicitly.Writing simple action creators can be tiresome and often ends up generating redundant boilerplate code:export function addTodo(text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nexport function editTodo(id, text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'EDIT_TODO',\n    id,\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nexport function removeTodo(id) {\n  return {\n    type: 'REMOVE_TODO',\n    id\n  }\n}\nYou can always write a function that generates an action creator:function makeActionCreator(type, ...argNames) {\n  return function(...args) {\n    let action = { type }\n    argNames.forEach((arg, index) => {\n      action[argNames[index]] = args[index]\n    })\n    return action\n  }\n}\n\nconst ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'\nconst EDIT_TODO = 'EDIT_TODO'\nconst REMOVE_TODO = 'REMOVE_TODO'\n\nexport const addTodo = makeActionCreator(ADD_TODO, 'todo')\nexport const editTodo = makeActionCreator(EDIT_TODO, 'id', 'todo')\nexport const removeTodo = makeActionCreator(REMOVE_TODO, 'id')\nThere are also utility libraries to aid in generating action creators, such as redux-act and redux-actions. These can help reduce boilerplate code and enforce adherence to standards such as Flux Standard Action (FSA).Async Action CreatorsMiddleware lets you inject custom logic that interprets every action object before it is dispatched. Async actions are the most common use case for middleware.Without any middleware, dispatch only accepts a plain object, so we have to perform AJAX calls inside our components:actionCreators.jsexport function loadPostsSuccess(userId, response) {\n  return {\n    type: 'LOAD_POSTS_SUCCESS',\n    userId,\n    response\n  }\n}\n\nexport function loadPostsFailure(userId, error) {\n  return {\n    type: 'LOAD_POSTS_FAILURE',\n    userId,\n    error\n  }\n}\n\nexport function loadPostsRequest(userId) {\n  return {\n    type: 'LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST',\n    userId\n  }\n}\nUserInfo.jsimport { Component } from 'react'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { loadPostsRequest, loadPostsSuccess, loadPostsFailure } from './actionCreators'\n\nclass Posts extends Component {\n  loadData(userId) {\n    // Injected into props by React Redux `connect()` call:\n    let { dispatch, posts } = this.props\n\n    if (posts[userId]) {\n      // There is cached data! Don't do anything.\n      return\n    }\n\n    // Reducer can react to this action by setting\n    // `isFetching` and thus letting us show a spinner.\n    dispatch(loadPostsRequest(userId))\n\n    // Reducer can react to these actions by filling the `users`.\n    fetch(`http://myapi.com/users/${userId}/posts`).then(\n      response => dispatch(loadPostsSuccess(userId, response)),\n      error => dispatch(loadPostsFailure(userId, error))\n    )\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.loadData(this.props.userId)\n  }\n\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    if (nextProps.userId !== this.props.userId) {\n      this.loadData(nextProps.userId)\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.props.isFetching) {\n      return Loading...\n    }\n\n    let posts = this.props.posts.map(post =>\n      \n    )\n\n    return {posts}\n  }\n}\n\nexport default connect(state => ({\n  posts: state.posts\n}))(Posts)\nHowever, this quickly gets repetitive because different components request data from the same API endpoints. Moreover, we want to reuse some of this logic (e.g., early exit when there is cached data available) from many components.Middleware lets us write more expressive, potentially async action creators. It lets us dispatch something other than plain objects, and interprets the values. For example, middleware can “catch” dispatched Promises and turn them into a pair of request and success/failure actions.The simplest example of middleware is redux-thunk. “Thunk” middleware lets you write action creators as “thunks”, that is, functions returning functions. This inverts the control: you will get dispatch as an argument, so you can write an action creator that dispatches many times.NoteThunk middleware is just one example of middleware. Middleware is not about “letting you dispatch functions”. It's about letting you dispatch anything that the particular middleware you use knows how to handle. Thunk middleware adds a specific behavior when you dispatch functions, but it really depends on the middleware you use.Consider the code above rewritten with redux-thunk:actionCreators.jsexport function loadPosts(userId) {\n  // Interpreted by the thunk middleware:\n  return function (dispatch, getState) {\n    let { posts } = getState()\n    if (posts[userId]) {\n      // There is cached data! Don't do anything.\n      return\n    }\n\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST',\n      userId\n    })\n\n    // Dispatch vanilla actions asynchronously\n    fetch(`http://myapi.com/users/${userId}/posts`).then(\n      response => dispatch({\n        type: 'LOAD_POSTS_SUCCESS',\n        userId,\n        response\n      }),\n      error => dispatch({\n        type: 'LOAD_POSTS_FAILURE',\n        userId,\n        error\n      })\n    )\n  }\n}\nUserInfo.jsimport { Component } from 'react'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { loadPosts } from './actionCreators'\n\nclass Posts extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.props.dispatch(loadPosts(this.props.userId))\n  }\n\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    if (nextProps.userId !== this.props.userId) {\n      this.props.dispatch(loadPosts(nextProps.userId))\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.props.isFetching) {\n      return Loading...\n    }\n\n    let posts = this.props.posts.map(post =>\n      \n    )\n\n    return {posts}\n  }\n}\n\nexport default connect(state => ({\n  posts: state.posts\n}))(Posts)\nThis is much less typing! If you'd like, you can still have “vanilla” action creators like loadPostsSuccess which you'd use from a container loadPosts action creator.Finally, you can write your own middleware. Let's say you want to generalize the pattern above and describe your async action creators like this instead:export function loadPosts(userId) {\n  return {\n    // Types of actions to emit before and after\n    types: ['LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST', 'LOAD_POSTS_SUCCESS', 'LOAD_POSTS_FAILURE'],\n    // Check the cache (optional):\n    shouldCallAPI: (state) => !state.posts[userId],\n    // Perform the fetching:\n    callAPI: () => fetch(`http://myapi.com/users/${userId}/posts`),\n    // Arguments to inject in begin/end actions\n    payload: { userId }\n  }\n}\nThe middleware that interprets such actions could look like this:function callAPIMiddleware({ dispatch, getState }) {\n  return next => action => {\n    const {\n      types,\n      callAPI,\n      shouldCallAPI = () => true,\n      payload = {}\n    } = action\n\n    if (!types) {\n      // Normal action: pass it on\n      return next(action)\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !Array.isArray(types) ||\n      types.length !== 3 ||\n      !types.every(type => typeof type === 'string')\n    ) {\n      throw new Error('Expected an array of three string types.')\n    }\n\n    if (typeof callAPI !== 'function') {\n      throw new Error('Expected callAPI to be a function.')\n    }\n\n    if (!shouldCallAPI(getState())) {\n      return\n    }\n\n    const [ requestType, successType, failureType ] = types\n\n    dispatch(Object.assign({}, payload, {\n      type: requestType\n    }))\n\n    return callAPI().then(\n      response => dispatch(Object.assign({}, payload, {\n        response,\n        type: successType\n      })),\n      error => dispatch(Object.assign({}, payload, {\n        error,\n        type: failureType\n      }))\n    )\n  }\n}\nAfter passing it once to applyMiddleware(...middlewares), you can write all your API-calling action creators the same way:export function loadPosts(userId) {\n  return {\n    types: ['LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST', 'LOAD_POSTS_SUCCESS', 'LOAD_POSTS_FAILURE'],\n    shouldCallAPI: (state) => !state.posts[userId],\n    callAPI: () => fetch(`http://myapi.com/users/${userId}/posts`),\n    payload: { userId }\n  }\n}\n\nexport function loadComments(postId) {\n  return {\n    types: ['LOAD_COMMENTS_REQUEST', 'LOAD_COMMENTS_SUCCESS', 'LOAD_COMMENTS_FAILURE'],\n    shouldCallAPI: (state) => !state.comments[postId],\n    callAPI: () => fetch(`http://myapi.com/posts/${postId}/comments`),\n    payload: { postId }\n  }\n}\n\nexport function addComment(postId, message) {\n  return {\n    types: ['ADD_COMMENT_REQUEST', 'ADD_COMMENT_SUCCESS', 'ADD_COMMENT_FAILURE'],\n    callAPI: () => fetch(`http://myapi.com/posts/${postId}/comments`, {\n      method: 'post',\n      headers: {\n        'Accept': 'application/json',\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n      },\n      body: JSON.stringify({ message })\n    }),\n    payload: { postId, message }\n  }\n}\nReducersRedux reduces the boilerplate of Flux stores considerably by describing the update logic as a function. A function is simpler than an object, and much simpler than a class.Consider this Flux store:let _todos = []\n\nconst TodoStore = Object.assign({}, EventEmitter.prototype, {\n  getAll() {\n    return _todos\n  }\n})\n\nAppDispatcher.register(function (action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ActionTypes.ADD_TODO:\n      let text = action.text.trim()\n      _todos.push(text)\n      TodoStore.emitChange()\n  }\n})\n\nexport default TodoStore\nWith Redux, the same update logic can be described as a reducing function:export function todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n  case ActionTypes.ADD_TODO:\n    let text = action.text.trim()\n    return [ ...state, text ]\n  default:\n    return state\n  }\n}\nThe switch statement is not the real boilerplate. The real boilerplate of Flux is conceptual: the need to emit an update, the need to register the Store with a Dispatcher, the need for the Store to be an object (and the complications that arise when you want a universal app).It's unfortunate that many still choose Flux framework based on whether it uses switch statements in the documentation. If you don't like switch, you can solve this with a single function, as we show below.Generating ReducersLet's write a function that lets us express reducers as an object mapping from action types to handlers. For example, if we want our todos reducers to be defined like this:export const todos = createReducer([], {\n  [ActionTypes.ADD_TODO](state, action) {\n    let text = action.text.trim()\n    return [ ...state, text ]\n  }\n})\nWe can write the following helper to accomplish this:function createReducer(initialState, handlers) {\n  return function reducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    if (handlers.hasOwnProperty(action.type)) {\n      return handlers[action.type](state, action)\n    } else {\n      return state\n    }\n  }\n}\nThis wasn't difficult, was it? Redux doesn't provide such a helper function by default because there are many ways to write it. Maybe you want it to automatically convert plain JS objects to Immutable objects to hydrate the server state. Maybe you want to merge the returned state with the current state. There may be different approaches to a “catch all” handler. All of this depends on the conventions you choose for your team on a specific project.The Redux reducer API is (state, action) => state, but how you create those reducers is up to you."},"docs/recipes/ServerRendering.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/ServerRendering.html","title":"Server Rendering","keywords":"","body":"Server RenderingThe most common use case for server-side rendering is to handle the initial render when a user (or search engine crawler) first requests our app.  When the server receives the request, it renders the required component(s) into an HTML string, and then sends it as a response to the client.  From that point on, the client takes over rendering duties.We will use React in the examples below, but the same techniques can be used with other view frameworks that can render on the server.Redux on the ServerWhen using Redux with server rendering, we must also send the state of our app along in our response, so the client can use it as the initial state. This is important because, if we preload any data before generating the HTML, we want the client to also have access to this data. Otherwise, the markup generated on the client won't match the server markup, and the client would have to load the data again.To send the data down to the client, we need to:create a fresh, new Redux store instance on every request;\n\noptionally dispatch some actions;\n\npull the state out of store;\n\nand then pass the state along to the client.\n\nOn the client side, a new Redux store will be created and initialized with the state provided from the server.Redux's only job on the server side is to provide the initial state of our app.Setting UpIn the following recipe, we are going to look at how to set up server-side rendering. We'll use the simplistic Counter app as a guide and show how the server can render state ahead of time based on the request.Install PackagesFor this example, we'll be using Express as a simple web server. We also need to install the React bindings for Redux, since they are not included in Redux by default.npm install --save express react-redux\nThe Server SideThe following is the outline for what our server side is going to look like. We are going to set up an Express middleware using app.use to handle all requests that come in to our server. If you're unfamiliar with Express or middleware, just know that our handleRender function will be called every time the server receives a request.server.jsimport path from 'path'\nimport Express from 'express'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\nimport counterApp from './reducers'\nimport App from './containers/App'\n\nconst app = Express()\nconst port = 3000\n\n// This is fired every time the server side receives a request\napp.use(handleRender)\n\n// We are going to fill these out in the sections to follow\nfunction handleRender(req, res) { /* ... */ }\nfunction renderFullPage(html, preloadedState) { /* ... */ }\n\napp.listen(port)\nHandling the RequestThe first thing that we need to do on every request is create a new Redux store instance. The only purpose of this store instance is to provide the initial state of our application.When rendering, we will wrap , our root component, inside a  to make the store available to all components in the component tree, as we saw in Usage with React.The key step in server side rendering is to render the initial HTML of our component before we send it to the client side. To do this, we use ReactDOMServer.renderToString().We then get the initial state from our Redux store using store.getState(). We will see how this is passed along in our renderFullPage function.import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'\n\nfunction handleRender(req, res) {\n  // Create a new Redux store instance\n  const store = createStore(counterApp)\n\n  // Render the component to a string\n  const html = renderToString(\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n\n  // Grab the initial state from our Redux store\n  const preloadedState = store.getState()\n\n  // Send the rendered page back to the client\n  res.send(renderFullPage(html, preloadedState))\n}\nInject Initial Component HTML and StateThe final step on the server side is to inject our initial component HTML and initial state into a template to be rendered on the client side. To pass along the state, we add a  tag that will attach preloadedState to window.__PRELOADED_STATE__.The preloadedState will then be available on the client side by accessing window.__PRELOADED_STATE__.We also include our bundle file for the client-side application via a script tag. This is whatever output your bundling tool provides for your client entry point. It may be a static file or a URL to a hot reloading development server.function renderFullPage(html, preloadedState) {\n  return `\n    \n    \n      \n        Redux Universal Example\n      \n      \n        ${html}\n        \n          window.__PRELOADED_STATE__ = ${JSON.stringify(preloadedState)}\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    `\n}\nNote on String Interpolation SyntaxIn the example above, we use ES6 template strings syntax. It lets us write multiline strings and interpolate values, but it requires ES6 support. If you'd like to write your Node code using ES6, check out Babel require hook documentation. Or you can just keep writing ES5 code.The Client SideThe client side is very straightforward. All we need to do is grab the initial state from window.__PRELOADED_STATE__, and pass it to our createStore() function as the initial state.Let's take a look at our new client file:client.jsimport React from 'react'\nimport { render } from 'react-dom'\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\nimport App from './containers/App'\nimport counterApp from './reducers'\n\n// Grab the state from a global injected into server-generated HTML\nconst preloadedState = window.__PRELOADED_STATE__\n\n// Create Redux store with initial state\nconst store = createStore(counterApp, preloadedState)\n\nrender(\n  \n    \n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\nYou can set up your build tool of choice (Webpack, Browserify, etc.) to compile a bundle file into static/bundle.js.When the page loads, the bundle file will be started up and ReactDOM.render() will hook into the data-react-id attributes from the server-rendered HTML. This will connect our newly-started React instance to the virtual DOM used on the server. Since we have the same initial state for our Redux store and used the same code for all our view components, the result will be the same real DOM.And that's it! That is all we need to do to implement server side rendering.But the result is pretty vanilla. It essentially renders a static view from dynamic code. What we need to do next is build an initial state dynamically to allow that rendered view to be dynamic.Preparing the Initial StateBecause the client side executes ongoing code, it can start with an empty initial state and obtain any necessary state on demand and over time. On the server side, rendering is synchronous and we only get one shot to render our view. We need to be able to compile our initial state during the request, which will have to react to input and obtain external state (such as that from an API or database).Processing Request ParametersThe only input for server side code is the request made when loading up a page in your app in your browser. You may choose to configure the server during its boot (such as when you are running in a development vs. production environment), but that configuration is static.The request contains information about the URL requested, including any query parameters, which will be useful when using something like React Router. It can also contain headers with inputs like cookies or authorization, or POST body data. Let's see how we can set the initial counter state based on a query parameter.server.jsimport qs from 'qs' // Add this at the top of the file\nimport { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'\n\nfunction handleRender(req, res) {\n  // Read the counter from the request, if provided\n  const params = qs.parse(req.query)\n  const counter = parseInt(params.counter, 10) || 0\n\n  // Compile an initial state\n  let preloadedState = { counter }\n\n  // Create a new Redux store instance\n  const store = createStore(counterApp, preloadedState)\n\n  // Render the component to a string\n  const html = renderToString(\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n\n  // Grab the initial state from our Redux store\n  const finalState = store.getState()\n\n  // Send the rendered page back to the client\n  res.send(renderFullPage(html, finalState))\n}\nThe code reads from the Express Request object passed into our server middleware. The parameter is parsed into a number and then set in the initial state. If you visit http://localhost:3000/?counter=100 in your browser, you'll see the counter starts at 100. In the rendered HTML, you'll see the counter output as 100 and the __PRELOADED_STATE__ variable has the counter set in it.Async State FetchingThe most common issue with server side rendering is dealing with state that comes in asynchronously. Rendering on the server is synchronous by nature, so it's necessary to map any asynchronous fetches into a synchronous operation.The easiest way to do this is to pass through some callback back to your synchronous code. In this case, that will be a function that will reference the response object and send back our rendered HTML to the client. Don't worry, it's not as hard as it may sound.For our example, we'll imagine there is an external datastore that contains the counter's initial value (Counter As A Service, or CaaS). We'll make a mock call over to them and build our initial state from the result. We'll start by building out our API call:api/counter.jsfunction getRandomInt(min, max) {\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min\n}\n\nexport function fetchCounter(callback) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    callback(getRandomInt(1, 100))\n  }, 500)\n}\nAgain, this is just a mock API, so we use setTimeout to simulate a network request that takes 500 milliseconds to respond (this should be much faster with a real world API). We pass in a callback that returns a random number asynchronously. If you're using a Promise-based API client, then you would issue this callback in your then handler.On the server side, we simply wrap our existing code in the fetchCounter and receive the result in the callback:server.js// Add this to our imports\nimport { fetchCounter } from './api/counter'\nimport { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'\n\nfunction handleRender(req, res) {\n  // Query our mock API asynchronously\n  fetchCounter(apiResult => {\n    // Read the counter from the request, if provided\n    const params = qs.parse(req.query)\n    const counter = parseInt(params.counter, 10) || apiResult || 0\n\n    // Compile an initial state\n    let preloadedState = { counter }\n\n    // Create a new Redux store instance\n    const store = createStore(counterApp, preloadedState)\n\n    // Render the component to a string\n    const html = renderToString(\n      \n        \n      \n    )\n\n    // Grab the initial state from our Redux store\n    const finalState = store.getState()\n\n    // Send the rendered page back to the client\n    res.send(renderFullPage(html, finalState))\n  })\n}\nBecause we call res.send() inside of the callback, the server will hold open the connection and won't send any data until that callback executes. You'll notice a 500ms delay is now added to each server request as a result of our new API call. A more advanced usage would handle errors in the API gracefully, such as a bad response or timeout.Security ConsiderationsBecause we have introduced more code that relies on user generated content (UGC) and input, we have increased our attack surface area for our application. It is important for any application that you ensure your input is properly sanitized to prevent things like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or code injections.In our example, we take a rudimentary approach to security. When we obtain the parameters from the request, we use parseInt on the counter parameter to ensure this value is a number. If we did not do this, you could easily get dangerous data into the rendered HTML by providing a script tag in the request. That might look like this: ?counter=doSomethingBad();For our simplistic example, coercing our input into a number is sufficiently secure. If you're handling more complex input, such as freeform text, then you should run that input through an appropriate sanitization function, such as validator.js.Furthermore, you can add additional layers of security by sanitizing your state output. JSON.stringify can be subject to script injections. To counter this, you can scrub the JSON string of HTML tags and other dangerous characters. This can be done with either a simple text replacement on the string or via more sophisticated libraries such as serialize-javascript.Next StepsYou may want to read Async Actions to learn more about expressing asynchronous flow in Redux with async primitives such as Promises and thunks. Keep in mind that anything you learn there can also be applied to universal rendering.If you use something like React Router, you might also want to express your data fetching dependencies as static fetchData() methods on your route handler components. They may return async actions, so that your handleRender function can match the route to the route handler component classes, dispatch fetchData() result for each of them, and render only after the Promises have resolved. This way the specific API calls required for different routes are colocated with the route handler component definitions. You can also use the same technique on the client side to prevent the router from switching the page until its data has been loaded."},"docs/recipes/WritingTests.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/WritingTests.html","title":"Writing Tests","keywords":"","body":"Writing TestsBecause most of the Redux code you write are functions, and many of them are pure, they are easy to test without mocking.Setting UpWe recommend Jest as the testing engine.\nNote that it runs in a Node environment, so you won't have access to the DOM.npm install --save-dev jest\nTo use it together with Babel, you will need to install babel-jest:npm install --save-dev babel-jest\nand configure it to use ES2015 features in .babelrc:{\n  \"presets\": [\"es2015\"]\n}\nThen, add this to scripts in your package.json:{\n  ...\n  \"scripts\": {\n    ...\n    \"test\": \"jest\",\n    \"test:watch\": \"npm test -- --watch\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\nand run npm test to run it once, or npm run test:watch to test on every file change.Action CreatorsIn Redux, action creators are functions which return plain objects. When testing action creators we want to test whether the correct action creator was called and also whether the right action was returned.Exampleexport function addTodo(text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    text\n  }\n}\ncan be tested like:import * as actions from '../../actions/TodoActions'\nimport * as types from '../../constants/ActionTypes'\n\ndescribe('actions', () => {\n  it('should create an action to add a todo', () => {\n    const text = 'Finish docs'\n    const expectedAction = {\n      type: types.ADD_TODO,\n      text\n    }\n    expect(actions.addTodo(text)).toEqual(expectedAction)\n  })\n})\nAsync Action CreatorsFor async action creators using Redux Thunk or other middleware, it's best to completely mock the Redux store for tests. You can apply the middleware to a mock store using redux-mock-store. You can also use nock to mock the HTTP requests.Exampleimport fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch';\n\nfunction fetchTodosRequest() {\n  return {\n    type: FETCH_TODOS_REQUEST\n  }\n}\n\nfunction fetchTodosSuccess(body) {\n  return {\n    type: FETCH_TODOS_SUCCESS,\n    body\n  }\n}\n\nfunction fetchTodosFailure(ex) {\n  return {\n    type: FETCH_TODOS_FAILURE,\n    ex\n  }\n}\n\nexport function fetchTodos() {\n  return dispatch => {\n    dispatch(fetchTodosRequest())\n    return fetch('http://example.com/todos')\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(json => dispatch(fetchTodosSuccess(json.body)))\n      .catch(ex => dispatch(fetchTodosFailure(ex)))\n  }\n}\ncan be tested like:import configureMockStore from 'redux-mock-store'\nimport thunk from 'redux-thunk'\nimport * as actions from '../../actions/counter'\nimport * as types from '../../constants/ActionTypes'\nimport nock from 'nock'\nimport expect from 'expect' // You can use any testing library\n\nconst middlewares = [ thunk ]\nconst mockStore = configureMockStore(middlewares)\n\ndescribe('async actions', () => {\n  afterEach(() => {\n    nock.cleanAll()\n  })\n\n  it('creates FETCH_TODOS_SUCCESS when fetching todos has been done', () => {\n    nock('http://example.com/')\n      .get('/todos')\n      .reply(200, { body: { todos: ['do something'] }})\n\n    const expectedActions = [\n      { type: types.FETCH_TODOS_REQUEST },\n      { type: types.FETCH_TODOS_SUCCESS, body: { todos: ['do something']  } }\n    ]\n    const store = mockStore({ todos: [] })\n\n    return store.dispatch(actions.fetchTodos())\n      .then(() => { // return of async actions\n        expect(store.getActions()).toEqual(expectedActions)\n      })\n  })\n})\nReducersA reducer should return the new state after applying the action to the previous state, and that's the behavior tested below.Exampleimport { ADD_TODO } from '../constants/ActionTypes'\n\nconst initialState = [\n  {\n    text: 'Use Redux',\n    completed: false,\n    id: 0\n  }\n]\n\nexport default function todos(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return [\n        {\n          id: state.reduce((maxId, todo) => Math.max(todo.id, maxId), -1) + 1,\n          completed: false,\n          text: action.text\n        },\n        ...state\n      ]\n\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\ncan be tested like:import reducer from '../../reducers/todos'\nimport * as types from '../../constants/ActionTypes'\n\ndescribe('todos reducer', () => {\n  it('should return the initial state', () => {\n    expect(\n      reducer(undefined, {})\n    ).toEqual([\n      {\n        text: 'Use Redux',\n        completed: false,\n        id: 0\n      }\n    ])\n  })\n\n  it('should handle ADD_TODO', () => {\n    expect(\n      reducer([], {\n        type: types.ADD_TODO,\n        text: 'Run the tests'\n      })\n    ).toEqual(\n      [\n        {\n          text: 'Run the tests',\n          completed: false,\n          id: 0\n        }\n      ]\n    )\n\n    expect(\n      reducer(\n        [\n          {\n            text: 'Use Redux',\n            completed: false,\n            id: 0\n          }\n        ],\n        {\n          type: types.ADD_TODO,\n          text: 'Run the tests'\n        }\n      )\n    ).toEqual(\n      [\n        {\n          text: 'Run the tests',\n          completed: false,\n          id: 1\n        },\n        {\n          text: 'Use Redux',\n          completed: false,\n          id: 0\n        }\n      ]\n    )\n  })\n})\nComponentsA nice thing about React components is that they are usually small and only rely on their props. That makes them easy to test.First, we will install Enzyme. Enzyme uses the React Test Utilities underneath, but is more convenient, readable, and powerful.npm install --save-dev enzyme\nTo test the components we make a setup() helper that passes the stubbed callbacks as props and renders the component with shallow rendering. This lets individual tests assert on whether the callbacks were called when expected.Exampleimport React, { PropTypes, Component } from 'react'\nimport TodoTextInput from './TodoTextInput'\n\nclass Header extends Component {\n  handleSave(text) {\n    if (text.length !== 0) {\n      this.props.addTodo(text)\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n          todos\n          \n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nHeader.propTypes = {\n  addTodo: PropTypes.func.isRequired\n}\n\nexport default Header\ncan be tested like:import React from 'react'\nimport { shallow } from 'enzyme'\nimport Header from '../../components/Header'\n\nfunction setup() {\n  const props = {\n    addTodo: jest.fn()\n  }\n\n  const enzymeWrapper = shallow()\n\n  return {\n    props,\n    enzymeWrapper\n  }\n}\n\ndescribe('components', () => {\n  describe('Header', () => {\n    it('should render self and subcomponents', () => {\n      const { enzymeWrapper } = setup()\n\n      expect(enzymeWrapper.find('header').hasClass('header')).toBe(true)\n\n      expect(enzymeWrapper.find('h1').text()).toBe('todos')\n\n      const todoInputProps = enzymeWrapper.find('TodoTextInput').props()\n      expect(todoInputProps.newTodo).toBe(true)\n      expect(todoInputProps.placeholder).toEqual('What needs to be done?')\n    })\n\n    it('should call addTodo if length of text is greater than 0', () => {\n      const { enzymeWrapper, props } = setup()\n      const input = enzymeWrapper.find('TodoTextInput')\n      input.props().onSave('')\n      expect(props.addTodo.mock.calls.length).toBe(0)\n      input.props().onSave('Use Redux')\n      expect(props.addTodo.mock.calls.length).toBe(1)\n    })\n  })\n})\n\nConnected ComponentsIf you use a library like React Redux, you might be using higher-order components like connect(). This lets you inject Redux state into a regular React component.Consider the following App component:import { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\nclass App extends Component { /* ... */ }\n\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(App)\nIn a unit test, you would normally import the App component like this:import App from './App'\nHowever, when you import it, you're actually holding the wrapper component returned by connect(), and not the App component itself. If you want to test its interaction with Redux, this is good news: you can wrap it in a  with a store created specifically for this unit test. But sometimes you want to test just the rendering of the component, without a Redux store.In order to be able to test the App component itself without having to deal with the decorator, we recommend you to also export the undecorated component:import { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\n// Use named export for unconnected component (for tests)\nexport class App extends Component { /* ... */ }\n\n// Use default export for the connected component (for app)\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(App)\nSince the default export is still the decorated component, the import statement pictured above will work as before so you won't have to change your application code. However, you can now import the undecorated App components in your test file like this:// Note the curly braces: grab the named export instead of default export\nimport { App } from './App'\nAnd if you need both:import ConnectedApp, { App } from './App'\nIn the app itself, you would still import it normally:import App from './App'\nYou would only use the named export for tests.A Note on Mixing ES6 Modules and CommonJSIf you are using ES6 in your application source, but write your tests in ES5, you should know that Babel handles the interchangeable use of ES6 import and CommonJS require through its interop capability to run two module formats side-by-side, but the behavior is slightly different. If you add a second export beside your default export, you can no longer import the default using require('./App'). Instead you have to use require('./App').default.MiddlewareMiddleware functions wrap behavior of dispatch calls in Redux, so to test this modified behavior we need to mock the behavior of the dispatch call.Exampleimport * as types from '../../constants/ActionTypes'\nimport singleDispatch from '../../middleware/singleDispatch'\n\nconst createFakeStore = fakeData => ({\n  getState() {\n    return fakeData\n  }\n})\n\nconst dispatchWithStoreOf = (storeData, action) => {\n  let dispatched = null\n  const dispatch = singleDispatch(createFakeStore(storeData))(actionAttempt => dispatched = actionAttempt)\n  dispatch(action)\n  return dispatched\n}\n\ndescribe('middleware', () => {\n  it('should dispatch if store is empty', () => {\n    const action = {\n      type: types.ADD_TODO\n    }\n\n    expect(\n      dispatchWithStoreOf({}, action)\n    ).toEqual(action)\n  })\n\n  it('should not dispatch if store already has type', () => {\n    const action = {\n      type: types.ADD_TODO\n    }\n\n    expect(\n      dispatchWithStoreOf({\n        [types.ADD_TODO]: 'dispatched'\n      }, action)\n    ).toNotExist()\n  })\n})\nGlossaryEnzyme: Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.\nReact Test Utils: Test Utilities for React. Used by Enzyme.\nShallow rendering: Shallow rendering lets you instantiate a component and effectively get the result of its render method just a single level deep instead of rendering components recursively to a DOM. Shallow rendering is useful for unit tests, where you test a particular component only, and importantly not its children. This also means that changing a child component won't affect the tests for the parent component. Testing a component and all its children can be accomplished with Enzyme's mount() method, aka full DOM rendering.\n"},"docs/recipes/ComputingDerivedData.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/ComputingDerivedData.html","title":"Computing Derived Data","keywords":"","body":"Computing Derived DataReselect is a simple library for creating memoized, composable selector functions. Reselect selectors can be used to efficiently compute derived data from the Redux store.Motivation for Memoized SelectorsLet's revisit the Todos List example:containers/VisibleTodoList.jsimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '../actions'\nimport TodoList from '../components/TodoList'\n\nconst getVisibleTodos = (todos, filter) => {\n  switch (filter) {\n    case 'SHOW_ALL':\n      return todos\n    case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n      return todos.filter(t => t.completed)\n    case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n      return todos.filter(t => !t.completed)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: (id) => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\nIn the above example, mapStateToProps calls getVisibleTodos to calculate todos. This works great, but there is a drawback: todos is calculated every time the component is updated. If the state tree is large, or the calculation expensive, repeating the calculation on every update may cause performance problems. Reselect can help to avoid these unnecessary recalculations.Creating a Memoized SelectorWe would like to replace getVisibleTodos with a memoized selector that recalculates todos when the value of state.todos or state.visibilityFilter changes, but not when changes occur in other (unrelated) parts of the state tree.Reselect provides a function createSelector for creating memoized selectors. createSelector takes an array of input-selectors and a transform function as its arguments. If the Redux state tree is mutated in a way that causes the value of an input-selector to change, the selector will call its transform function with the values of the input-selectors as arguments and return the result. If the values of the input-selectors are the same as the previous call to the selector, it will return the previously computed value instead of calling the transform function.Let's define a memoized selector named getVisibleTodos to replace the non-memoized version above:selectors/index.jsimport { createSelector } from 'reselect'\n\nconst getVisibilityFilter = (state) => state.visibilityFilter\nconst getTodos = (state) => state.todos\n\nexport const getVisibleTodos = createSelector(\n  [ getVisibilityFilter, getTodos ],\n  (visibilityFilter, todos) => {\n    switch (visibilityFilter) {\n      case 'SHOW_ALL':\n        return todos\n      case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n        return todos.filter(t => t.completed)\n      case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n        return todos.filter(t => !t.completed)\n    }\n  }\n)\nIn the example above, getVisibilityFilter and getTodos are input-selectors. They are created as ordinary non-memoized selector functions because they do not transform the data they select. getVisibleTodos on the other hand is a memoized selector. It takes getVisibilityFilter and getTodos as input-selectors, and a transform function that calculates the filtered todos list.Composing SelectorsA memoized selector can itself be an input-selector to another memoized selector. Here is getVisibleTodos being used as an input-selector to a selector that further filters the todos by keyword:const getKeyword = (state) => state.keyword\n\nconst getVisibleTodosFilteredByKeyword = createSelector(\n  [ getVisibleTodos, getKeyword ],\n  (visibleTodos, keyword) => visibleTodos.filter(\n    todo => todo.text.indexOf(keyword) > -1\n  )\n)\nConnecting a Selector to the Redux StoreIf you are using React Redux, you can call selectors as regular functions inside mapStateToProps():containers/VisibleTodoList.jsimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '../actions'\nimport TodoList from '../components/TodoList'\nimport { getVisibleTodos } from '../selectors'\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: (id) => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\nAccessing React Props in SelectorsThis section introduces an hypothetical extension to our app that allows it to support multiple Todo Lists. Please note that a full implementation of this extension requires changes to the reducers, components, actions etc. that aren't directly relevant to the topics discussed and have been omitted for brevity.So far we have only seen selectors receive the Redux store state as an argument, but a selector can receive props too.Here is an App component that renders three VisibleTodoList components, each of which has a listId prop:components/App.jsimport React from 'react'\nimport Footer from './Footer'\nimport AddTodo from '../containers/AddTodo'\nimport VisibleTodoList from '../containers/VisibleTodoList'\n\nconst App = () => (\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n)\nEach VisibleTodoList container should select a different slice of the state depending on the value of the listId prop, so let's modify getVisibilityFilter and getTodos to accept a props argument:selectors/todoSelectors.jsimport { createSelector } from 'reselect'\n\nconst getVisibilityFilter = (state, props) =>\n  state.todoLists[props.listId].visibilityFilter\n\nconst getTodos = (state, props) =>\n  state.todoLists[props.listId].todos\n\nconst getVisibleTodos = createSelector(\n  [ getVisibilityFilter, getTodos ],\n  (visibilityFilter, todos) => {\n    switch (visibilityFilter) {\n      case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n        return todos.filter(todo => todo.completed)\n      case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n        return todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed)\n      default:\n        return todos\n    }\n  }\n)\n\nexport default getVisibleTodos\nprops can be passed to getVisibleTodos from mapStateToProps:const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state, props)\n  }\n}\nSo now getVisibleTodos has access to props, and everything seems to be working fine.But there is a problem!Using the getVisibleTodos selector with multiple instances of the visibleTodoList container will not correctly memoize:containers/VisibleTodoList.jsimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '../actions'\nimport TodoList from '../components/TodoList'\nimport { getVisibleTodos } from '../selectors'\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {\n  return {\n    // WARNING: THE FOLLOWING SELECTOR DOES NOT CORRECTLY MEMOIZE\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state, props)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: (id) => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\nA selector created with createSelector only returns the cached value when its set of arguments is the same as its previous set of arguments. If we alternate between rendering  and , the shared selector will alternate between receiving {listId: 1} and {listId: 2} as its props argument. This will cause the arguments to be different on each call, so the selector will always recompute instead of returning the cached value. We'll see how to overcome this limitation in the next section.Sharing Selectors Across Multiple ComponentsThe examples in this section require React Redux v4.3.0 or greaterIn order to share a selector across multiple VisibleTodoList components and retain memoization, each instance of the component needs its own private copy of the selector.Let's create a function named makeGetVisibleTodos that returns a new copy of the getVisibleTodos selector each time it is called:selectors/todoSelectors.jsimport { createSelector } from 'reselect'\n\nconst getVisibilityFilter = (state, props) =>\n  state.todoLists[props.listId].visibilityFilter\n\nconst getTodos = (state, props) =>\n  state.todoLists[props.listId].todos\n\nconst makeGetVisibleTodos = () => {\n  return createSelector(\n    [ getVisibilityFilter, getTodos ],\n    (visibilityFilter, todos) => {\n      switch (visibilityFilter) {\n        case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n          return todos.filter(todo => todo.completed)\n        case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n          return todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed)\n        default:\n          return todos\n      }\n    }\n  )\n}\n\nexport default makeGetVisibleTodos\nWe also need a way to give each instance of a container access to its own private selector. The mapStateToProps argument of connect can help with this.If the mapStateToProps argument supplied to connect returns a function instead of an object, it will be used to create an individual mapStateToProps function for each instance of the container.In the example below makeMapStateToProps creates a new getVisibleTodos selector, and returns a mapStateToProps function that has exclusive access to the new selector:const makeMapStateToProps = () => {\n  const getVisibleTodos = makeGetVisibleTodos()\n  const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {\n    return {\n      todos: getVisibleTodos(state, props)\n    }\n  }\n  return mapStateToProps\n}\nIf we pass makeMapStateToProps to connect, each instance of the VisibleTodosList container will get its own mapStateToProps function with a private getVisibleTodos selector. Memoization will now work correctly regardless of the render order of the VisibleTodoList containers.containers/VisibleTodoList.jsimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '../actions'\nimport TodoList from '../components/TodoList'\nimport { makeGetVisibleTodos } from '../selectors'\n\nconst makeMapStateToProps = () => {\n  const getVisibleTodos = makeGetVisibleTodos()\n  const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {\n    return {\n      todos: getVisibleTodos(state, props)\n    }\n  }\n  return mapStateToProps\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: (id) => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  makeMapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\nNext StepsCheck out the official documentation of Reselect as well as its FAQ. Most Redux projects start using Reselect when they have performance problems because of too many derived computations and wasted re-renders, so make sure you are familiar with it before you build something big. It can also be useful to study its source code so you don't think it's magic."},"docs/recipes/ImplementingUndoHistory.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/ImplementingUndoHistory.html","title":"Implementing Undo History","keywords":"","body":"Implementing Undo HistoryBuilding an Undo and Redo functionality into an app has traditionally required conscious effort from the developer. It is not an easy problem with classical MVC frameworks because you need to keep track of every past state by cloning all relevant models. In addition, you need to be mindful of the undo stack because the user-initiated changes should be undoable.This means that implementing Undo and Redo in an MVC application usually forces you to rewrite parts of your application to use a specific data mutation pattern like Command.With Redux, however, implementing undo history is a breeze. There are three reasons for this:There are no multiple models—just a state subtree that you want to keep track of.\n\nThe state is already immutable, and mutations are already described as discrete actions, which is close to the undo stack mental model.\n\nThe reducer (state, action) => state signature makes it natural to implement generic “reducer enhancers” or “higher order reducers”. They are functions that take your reducer and enhance it with some additional functionality while preserving its signature. Undo history is exactly such a case.\n\nBefore proceeding, make sure you have worked through the basics tutorial and understand reducer composition well. This recipe will build on top of the example described in the basics tutorial.In the first part of this recipe, we will explain the underlying concepts that make Undo and Redo possible to implement in a generic way.In the second part of this recipe, we will show how to use Redux Undo package that provides this functionality out of the box.Understanding Undo HistoryDesigning the State ShapeUndo history is also part of your app's state, and there is no reason why we should approach it differently. Regardless of the type of the state changing over time, when you implement Undo and Redo, you want to keep track of the history of this state at different points in time.For example, the state shape of a counter app might look like this:{\n  counter: 10\n}\nIf we wanted to implement Undo and Redo in such an app, we'd need to store more state so we can answer the following questions:Is there anything left to undo or redo?\n\nWhat is the current state?\n\nWhat are the past (and future) states in the undo stack?\n\nIt is reasonable to suggest that our state shape should change to answer these questions:{\n  counter: {\n    past: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ],\n    present: 10,\n    future: []\n  }\n}\nNow, if user presses “Undo”, we want it to change to move into the past:{\n  counter: {\n    past: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ],\n    present: 9,\n    future: [ 10 ]\n  }\n}\nAnd further yet:{\n  counter: {\n    past: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ],\n    present: 8,\n    future: [ 9, 10 ]\n  }\n}\nWhen the user presses “Redo”, we want to move one step back into the future:{\n  counter: {\n    past: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ],\n    present: 9,\n    future: [ 10 ]\n  }\n}\nFinally, if the user performs an action (e.g. decrement the counter) while we're in the middle of the undo stack, we're going to discard the existing future:{\n  counter: {\n    past: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ],\n    present: 8,\n    future: []\n  }\n}\nThe interesting part here is that it does not matter whether we want to keep an undo stack of numbers, strings, arrays, or objects. The structure will always be the same:{\n  counter: {\n    past: [ 0, 1, 2 ],\n    present: 3,\n    future: [ 4 ]\n  }\n}\n{\n  todos: {\n    past: [\n      [],\n      [ { text: 'Use Redux' } ],\n      [ { text: 'Use Redux', complete: true } ]\n    ],\n    present: [ { text: 'Use Redux', complete: true }, { text: 'Implement Undo' } ],\n    future: [\n      [ { text: 'Use Redux', complete: true }, { text: 'Implement Undo', complete: true } ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\nIn general, it looks like this:{\n  past: Array,\n  present: T,\n  future: Array\n}\nIt is also up to us whether to keep a single top-level history:{\n  past: [\n    { counterA: 1, counterB: 1 },\n    { counterA: 1, counterB: 0 },\n    { counterA: 0, counterB: 0 }\n  ],\n  present: { counterA: 2, counterB: 1 },\n  future: []\n}\nOr many granular histories so user can undo and redo actions in them independently:{\n  counterA: {\n    past: [ 1, 0 ],\n    present: 2,\n    future: []\n  },\n  counterB: {\n    past: [ 0 ],\n    present: 1,\n    future: []\n  }\n}\nWe will see later how the approach we take lets us choose how granular Undo and Redo need to be.Designing the AlgorithmRegardless of the specific data type, the shape of the undo history state is the same:{\n  past: Array,\n  present: T,\n  future: Array\n}\nLet's talk through the algorithm to manipulate the state shape described above. We can define two actions to operate on this state: UNDO and REDO. In our reducer, we will do the following steps to handle these actions:Handling UndoRemove the last element from the past.\n\nSet the present to the element we removed in the previous step.\n\nInsert the old present state at the beginning of the future.\n\nHandling RedoRemove the first element from the future.\n\nSet the present to the element we removed in the previous step.\n\nInsert the old present state at the end of the past.\n\nHandling Other ActionsInsert the present at the end of the past.\n\nSet the present to the new state after handling the action.\n\nClear the future.\n\nFirst Attempt: Writing a Reducerconst initialState = {\n  past: [],\n  present: null, // (?) How do we initialize the present?\n  future: []\n}\n\nfunction undoable(state = initialState, action) {\n  const { past, present, future } = state\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'UNDO':\n      const previous = past[past.length - 1]\n      const newPast = past.slice(0, past.length - 1)\n      return {\n        past: newPast,\n        present: previous,\n        future: [ present, ...future ]\n      }\n    case 'REDO':\n      const next = future[0]\n      const newFuture = future.slice(1)\n      return {\n        past: [ ...past, present ],\n        present: next,\n        future: newFuture\n      }\n    default:\n      // (?) How do we handle other actions?\n      return state\n  }\n}\nThis implementation isn't usable because it leaves out three important questions:Where do we get the initial present state from? We don't seem to know it beforehand.\n\nWhere do we react to the external actions to save the present to the past?\n\nHow do we actually delegate the control over the present state to a custom reducer?\n\nIt seems that reducer isn't the right abstraction, but we're very close.Meet Reducer EnhancersYou might be familiar with higher order functions. If you use React, you might be familiar with higher order components. Here is a variation on the same pattern, applied to reducers.A reducer enhancer (or a higher order reducer) is a function that takes a reducer, and returns a new reducer that is able to handle new actions, or to hold more state, delegating control to the inner reducer for the actions it doesn't understand. This isn't a new pattern—technically, combineReducers() is also a reducer enhancer because it takes reducers and returns a new reducer.A reducer enhancer that doesn't do anything looks like this:function doNothingWith(reducer) {\n  return function (state, action) {\n    // Just call the passed reducer\n    return reducer(state, action)\n  }\n}\nA reducer enhancer that combines other reducers might look like this:function combineReducers(reducers) {\n  return function (state = {}, action) {\n    return Object.keys(reducers).reduce((nextState, key) => {\n      // Call every reducer with the part of the state it manages\n      nextState[key] = reducers[key](state[key], action)\n      return nextState\n    }, {})\n  }\n}\nSecond Attempt: Writing a Reducer EnhancerNow that we have a better understanding of reducer enhancers, we can see that this is exactly what undoable should have been:function undoable(reducer) {\n  // Call the reducer with empty action to populate the initial state\n  const initialState = {\n    past: [],\n    present: reducer(undefined, {}),\n    future: []\n  }\n\n  // Return a reducer that handles undo and redo\n  return function (state = initialState, action) {\n    const { past, present, future } = state\n\n    switch (action.type) {\n      case 'UNDO':\n        const previous = past[past.length - 1]\n        const newPast = past.slice(0, past.length - 1)\n        return {\n          past: newPast,\n          present: previous,\n          future: [ present, ...future ]\n        }\n      case 'REDO':\n        const next = future[0]\n        const newFuture = future.slice(1)\n        return {\n          past: [ ...past, present ],\n          present: next,\n          future: newFuture\n        }\n      default:\n        // Delegate handling the action to the passed reducer\n        const newPresent = reducer(present, action)\n        if (present === newPresent) {\n          return state\n        }\n        return {\n          past: [ ...past, present ],\n          present: newPresent,\n          future: []\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\nWe can now wrap any reducer into undoable reducer enhancer to teach it to react to UNDO and REDO actions.// This is a reducer\nfunction todos(state = [], action) {\n  /* ... */\n}\n\n// This is also a reducer!\nconst undoableTodos = undoable(todos)\n\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nconst store = createStore(undoableTodos)\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  text: 'Use Redux'\n})\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  text: 'Implement Undo'\n})\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'UNDO'\n})\nThere is an important gotcha: you need to remember to append .present to the current state when you retrieve it. You may also check .past.length and .future.length to determine whether to enable or to disable the Undo and Redo buttons, respectively.You might have heard that Redux was influenced by Elm Architecture. It shouldn't come as a surprise that this example is very similar to elm-undo-redo package.Using Redux UndoThis was all very informative, but can't we just drop a library and use it instead of implementing undoable ourselves? Sure, we can! Meet Redux Undo, a library that provides simple Undo and Redo functionality for any part of your Redux tree.In this part of the recipe, you will learn how to make the Todo List example undoable. You can find the full source of this recipe in the todos-with-undo example that comes with Redux.InstallationFirst of all, you need to runnpm install --save redux-undo\nThis installs the package that provides the undoable reducer enhancer.Wrapping the ReducerYou will need to wrap the reducer you wish to enhance with undoable function. For example, if you exported a todos reducer from a dedicated file, you will want to change it to export the result of calling undoable() with the reducer you wrote:reducers/todos.jsimport undoable, { distinctState } from 'redux-undo'\n\n/* ... */\n\nconst todos = (state = [], action) => {\n  /* ... */\n}\n\nconst undoableTodos = undoable(todos, {\n  filter: distinctState()\n})\n\nexport default undoableTodos\nThe distinctState() filter serves to ignore the actions that didn't result in a state change. There are many other options to configure your undoable reducer, like setting the action type for Undo and Redo actions.Note that your combineReducers() call will stay exactly as it was, but the todos reducer will now refer to the reducer enhanced with Redux Undo:reducers/index.jsimport { combineReducers } from 'redux'\nimport todos from './todos'\nimport visibilityFilter from './visibilityFilter'\n\nconst todoApp = combineReducers({\n  todos,\n  visibilityFilter\n})\n\nexport default todoApp\nYou may wrap one or more reducers in undoable at any level of the reducer composition hierarchy. We choose to wrap todos instead of the top-level combined reducer so that changes to visibilityFilter are not reflected in the undo history.Updating the SelectorsNow the todos part of the state looks like this:{\n  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',\n  todos: {\n    past: [\n      [],\n      [ { text: 'Use Redux' } ],\n      [ { text: 'Use Redux', complete: true } ]\n    ],\n    present: [ { text: 'Use Redux', complete: true }, { text: 'Implement Undo' } ],\n    future: [\n      [ { text: 'Use Redux', complete: true }, { text: 'Implement Undo', complete: true } ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\nThis means you need to access your state with state.todos.present instead of\njust state.todos:containers/VisibleTodoList.jsconst mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos.present, state.visibilityFilter)\n  }\n}\nAdding the ButtonsNow all you need to do is add the buttons for the Undo and Redo actions.First, create a new container component called UndoRedo for these buttons. We won't bother to split the presentational part into a separate file because it is very small:containers/UndoRedo.jsimport React from 'react'\n\n/* ... */\n\nlet UndoRedo = ({ canUndo, canRedo, onUndo, onRedo }) => (\n  \n    \n      Undo\n    \n    \n      Redo\n    \n  \n)\nYou will use connect() from React Redux to generate a container component. To determine whether to enable Undo and Redo buttons, you can check state.todos.past.length and state.todos.future.length. You won't need to write action creators for performing undo and redo because Redux Undo already provides them:containers/UndoRedo.js/* ... */\n\nimport { ActionCreators as UndoActionCreators } from 'redux-undo'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\n/* ... */\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  return {\n    canUndo: state.todos.past.length > 0,\n    canRedo: state.todos.future.length > 0\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    onUndo: () => dispatch(UndoActionCreators.undo()),\n    onRedo: () => dispatch(UndoActionCreators.redo())\n  }\n}\n\nUndoRedo = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(UndoRedo)\n\nexport default UndoRedo\nNow you can add UndoRedo component to the App component:components/App.jsimport React from 'react'\nimport Footer from './Footer'\nimport AddTodo from '../containers/AddTodo'\nimport VisibleTodoList from '../containers/VisibleTodoList'\nimport UndoRedo from '../containers/UndoRedo'\n\nconst App = () => (\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n)\n\nexport default App\nThis is it!

The Redux store calls that write logic function and passes in the current state tree and the descriptive object, the write logic function returns some new state tree, and the Redux store notifies any subscribers that the state tree has changed.Redux puts some basic constraints on how that write logic function should work.  As described in Reducers, it has to have a signature of (previousState, action) => newState, is known as a reducer function, and must be pure and predictable.Beyond that, Redux does not really care how you actually structure your logic inside that reducer function, as long as it obeys those basic rules.  This is both a source of freedom and a source of confusion.  However, there are a number of common patterns that are widely used when writing reducers, as well as a number of related topics and concepts to be aware of.  As an application grows, these patterns play a crucial role in managing reducer code complexity, handling real-world data, and optimizing UI performance.Prerequisite Concepts for Writing ReducersSome of these concepts are already described elsewhere in the Redux documentation.  Others are generic and applicable outside of Redux itself, and there are numerous existing articles that cover these concepts in detail.  These concepts and techniques form the foundation of writing solid Redux reducer logic.It is vital that these Prerequisite Concepts are thoroughly understood before moving on to more advanced and Redux-specific techniques. A recommended reading list is available at:Prerequisite ConceptsIt's also important to note that some of these suggestions may or may not be directly applicable based on architectural decisions in a specific application.  For example, an application using Immutable.js Maps to store data would likely have its reducer logic structured at least somewhat differently than an application using plain Javascript objects.  This documentation primarily assumes use of plain Javascript objects, but many of the principles would still apply if using other tools.Reducer Concepts and TechniquesBasic Reducer Structure\n\nSplitting Reducer Logic\n\nRefactoring Reducers Example\n\nUsing combineReducers\n\nBeyond combineReducers\n\nNormalizing State Shape\n\nUpdating Normalized Data\n\nReusing Reducer Logic\n\nImmutable Update Patterns\n\nInitializing State\n\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/PrerequisiteConcepts.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/PrerequisiteConcepts.html","title":"Prerequisite Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Prerequisite Reducer ConceptsAs described in Reducers, a Redux reducer function:Should have a signature of (previousState, action) => newState, similar to the type of function you would pass to Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue)\n\nShould be \"pure\", which means it does not mutate its arguments, perform side effects like API calls or modifying values outside of the function, or call non-pure functions like Date.now() or Math.random().  This also means that updates should be done in an \"immutable\" fashion, which means always returning new objects with the updated data, rather than directly modifying the original state tree in-place.\n\nNote on immutability, side effects, and mutationMutation is discouraged because it generally breaks time-travel debugging, and React Redux's connect function:For time traveling, the Redux DevTools expect that replaying recorded actions would output a state value, but not change anything else. Side effects like mutation or asynchronous behavior will cause time travel to alter behavior between steps, breaking the application.\n\nFor React Redux, connect checks to see if the props returned from a mapStateToProps function have changed in order to determine if a component needs to update.  To improve performance, connect takes some shortcuts that rely on the state being immutable, and uses shallow reference equality checks to detect changes. This means that changes made to objects and arrays by direct mutation will not be detected, and components will not re-render.\n\nOther side effects like generating unique IDs or timestamps in a reducer also make the code unpredictable and harder to debug and test.Because of these rules, it's important that the following core concepts are fully understood before moving on to other specific techniques for organizing Redux reducers:Redux Reducer BasicsKey concepts:Thinking in terms of state and state shape\n\nDelegating update responsibility by slice of state (reducer composition)\n\nHigher order reducers\n\nDefining reducer initial state\n\nReading list:Redux Docs: Reducers\n\nRedux Docs: Reducing Boilerplate\n\nRedux Docs: Implementing Undo History\n\nRedux Docs: combineReducers\n\nThe Power of Higher-Order Reducers\n\nStack Overflow: Store initial state and combineReducers\n\nStack Overflow: State key names and combineReducers\n\nPure Functions and Side EffectsKey Concepts:Side effects\n\nPure functions\n\nHow to think in terms of combining functions\n\nReading List:The Little Idea of Functional Programming\n\nUnderstanding Programmatic Side Effects\n\nLearning Functional Programming in Javascript\n\nAn Introduction to Reasonably Pure Functional Programming\n\nImmutable Data ManagementKey Concepts:Mutability vs immutability\n\nImmutably updating objects and arrays safely\n\nAvoiding functions and statements that mutate state\n\nReading List:Pros and Cons of Using Immutability With React\n\nJavascript and Immutability\n\nImmutable Data using ES6 and Beyond\n\nImmutable Data from Scratch\n\nRedux Docs: Using the Object Spread Operator\n\nNormalizing DataKey Concepts:Database structure and organization\n\nSplitting relational/nested data up into separate tables\n\nStoring a single definition for a given item\n\nReferring to items by IDs\n\nUsing objects keyed by item IDs as lookup tables, and arrays of IDs to track ordering\n\nAssociating items in relationships\n\nReading List:Database Normalization in Simple English\n\nIdiomatic Redux: Normalizing the State Shape\n\nNormalizr Documentation\n\nRedux Without Profanity: Normalizr\n\nQuerying a Redux Store\n\nWikipedia: Associative Entity\n\nDatabase Design: Many-to-Many\n\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/BasicReducerStructure.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/BasicReducerStructure.html","title":"Basic Reducer Structure","keywords":"","body":"Basic Reducer Structure and State ShapeBasic Reducer StructureFirst and foremost, it's important to understand that your entire application really only has one single reducer function: the function that you've passed into createStore as the first argument.  That one single reducer function ultimately needs to do several things:The first time the reducer is called, the state value will be undefined.  The reducer needs to handle this case by supplying a default state value before handling the incoming action.\n\nIt needs to look at the previous state and the dispatched action, and determine what kind of work needs to be done\n\nAssuming actual changes need to occur, it needs to create new objects and arrays with the updated data and return those\n\nIf no changes are needed, it should return the existing state as-is. \n\nThe simplest possible approach to writing reducer logic is to put everything into a single function declaration, like this:function counter(state, action) {\n  if (typeof state === 'undefined') {\n    state = 0; // If state is undefined, initialize it with a default value\n  }\n\n  if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {\n    return state + 1;\n  } \n  else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {\n    return state - 1;\n  } \n  else {\n    return state; // In case an action is passed in we don't understand\n  }\n}\nNotice that this simple function fulfills all the basic requirements.  It returns a default value if none exists, initializing the store; it determines what sort of update needs to be done based on the type of the action, and returns new values; and it returns the previous state if no work needs to be done.There are some simple tweaks that can be made to this reducer.  First, repeated if/else statements quickly grow tiresome, so it's very common to use switch statements instead.  Second, we can use ES6's default parameter values to handle the initial \"no existing data\" case.  With those changes, the reducer would look like:function counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return state + 1;\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return state - 1;\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\nThis is the basic structure that a typical Redux reducer function uses.Basic State ShapeRedux encourages you to think about your application in terms of the data you need to manage.  The data at any given point in time is the \"state\" of your application, and the structure and organization of that state is typically referred to as its \"shape\".  The shape of your state plays a major role in how you structure your reducer logic.A Redux state usually has a plain Javascript object as the top of the state tree. (It is certainly possible to have another type of data instead, such as a single number, an array, or a specialized data structure, but most libraries assume that the top-level value is a plain object.)  The most common way to organize data within that top-level object is to further divide data into sub-trees, where each top-level key represents some \"domain\" or \"slice\" of related data.  For example, a basic Todo app's state might look like:{\n  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',\n  todos: [\n    {\n      text: 'Consider using Redux',\n      completed: true,\n    },\n    {\n      text: 'Keep all state in a single tree',\n      completed: false\n    }\n  ]\n}\nIn this example, todos and visibilityFilter are both top-level keys in the state, and each represents a \"slice\" of data for some particular concept.Most applications deal with multiple types of data, which can be broadly divided into three categories:Domain data: data that the application needs to show, use, or modify (such as \"all of the Todos retrieved from the server\")\n\nApp state: data that is specific to the application's behavior (such as \"Todo #5 is currently selected\", or \"there is a request in progress to fetch Todos\")\n\nUI state: data that represents how the UI is currently displayed (such as \"The EditTodo modal dialog is currently open\")\n\nBecause the store represents the core of your application, you should define your state shape in terms of your domain data and app state, not your UI component tree.  As an example, a shape of state.leftPane.todoList.todos would be a bad idea, because the idea of \"todos\" is central to the whole application, not just a single part of the UI.  The todos slice should be at the top of the state tree instead.There will rarely be a 1-to-1 correspondence between your UI tree and your state shape.  The exception to that might be if you are explicitly tracking various aspects of UI data in your Redux store as well, but even then the shape of the UI data and the shape of the domain data would likely be different.A typical app's state shape might look roughly like:{\n    domainData1 : {},\n    domainData2 : {},\n    appState1 : {},\n    appState2 : {},\n    ui : {\n        uiState1 : {},\n        uiState2 : {},\n    }\n}\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/SplittingReducerLogic.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/SplittingReducerLogic.html","title":"Splitting Reducer Logic","keywords":"","body":"Splitting Up Reducer LogicFor any meaningful application, putting all your update logic into a single reducer function is quickly going to become unmaintainable.  While there's no single rule for how long a function should be, it's generally agreed that functions should be relatively short and ideally only do one specific thing.  Because of this, it's good programming practice to take pieces of code that are very long or do many different things, and break them into smaller pieces that are easier to understand.Since a Redux reducer is just a function, the same concept applies.  You can split some of your reducer logic out into another function, and call that new function from the parent function.These new functions would typically fall into one of three categories:Small utility functions containing some reusable chunk of logic that is needed in multiple places (which may or may not be actually related to the specific business logic)\n\nFunctions for handling a specific update case, which often need parameters other than the typical (state, action) pair\n\nFunctions which handle all updates for a given slice of state.  These functions do generally have the typical (state, action) parameter signature\n\nFor clarity, these terms will be used to distinguish between different types of functions and different use cases:reducer: any function with the signature (state, action) -> newState (ie, any function that could be used as an argument to Array.reduce)\n\nroot reducer: the reducer function that is actually passed as the first argument to createStore.  This is the only part of the reducer logic that must have the (state, action) -> newState signature.\n\nslice reducer: a reducer that is being used to handle updates to one specific slice of the state tree, usually done by passing it to combineReducers\n\ncase function: a function that is being used to handle the update logic for a specific action.  This may actually be a reducer function, or it may require other parameters to do its work properly.\n\nhigher-order reducer: a function that takes a reducer function as an argument, and/or returns a new reducer function as a result (such as combineReducers, or redux-undo\n\nThe term \"sub-reducer\" has also been used in various discussions to mean any function that is not the root reducer, although the term is not very precise.  Some people may also refer to some functions as \"business logic\" (functions that relate to application-specific behavior) or \"utility functions\" (generic functions that are not application-specific).Breaking down a complex process into smaller, more understandable parts is usually described with the term functional decomposition.  This term and concept can be applied generically to any code.  However, in Redux it is very common to structure reducer logic using approach #3, where update logic is delegated to other functions based on slice of state.  Redux refers to this concept as reducer composition, and it is by far the most widely-used approach to structuring reducer logic.  In fact, it's so common that Redux includes a utility function called combineReducers(), which specifically abstracts the process of delegating work to other reducer functions based on slices of state. However, it's important to note that it is not the only pattern that can be used.  In fact, it's entirely possible to use all three approaches for splitting up logic into functions, and usually a good idea as well.  The Refactoring Reducers section shows some examples of this in action."},"docs/recipes/reducers/RefactoringReducersExample.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/RefactoringReducersExample.html","title":"Refactoring Reducers Example","keywords":"","body":"Refactoring Reducer Logic Using Functional Decomposition and Reducer CompositionIt may be helpful to see examples of what the different types of sub-reducer functions look like and how they fit together.  Let's look at a demonstration of how a large single reducer function can be refactored into a composition of several smaller functions.Note: this example is deliberately written in a verbose style in order to illustrate the concepts and the process of refactoring, rather than perfectly concise code.Initial ReducerLet's say that our initial reducer looks like this:const initialState = {\n    visibilityFilter : 'SHOW_ALL',\n    todos : []\n};\n\n\nfunction appReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' : { \n            return Object.assign({}, state, {\n                visibilityFilter : action.filter\n            });\n        }\n        case 'ADD_TODO' : {\n            return Object.assign({}, state, {\n                todos : state.todos.concat({\n                    id: action.id,\n                    text: action.text,\n                    completed: false\n                })\n            });\n        }\n        case 'TOGGLE_TODO' : {\n            return Object.assign({}, state, {\n                todos : state.todos.map(todo => {\n                    if (todo.id !== action.id) {\n                      return todo;\n                    }\n\n                    return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n                        completed : !todo.completed\n                    })\n                  })\n            });\n        } \n        case 'EDIT_TODO' : {\n            return Object.assign({}, state, {\n                todos : state.todos.map(todo => {\n                    if (todo.id !== action.id) {\n                      return todo;\n                    }\n\n                    return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n                        text : action.text\n                    })\n                  })\n            });\n        } \n        default : return state;\n    }\n}\n\nThat function is fairly short, but already becoming overly complex.  We're dealing with two different areas of concern (filtering vs managing our list of todos), the nesting is making the update logic harder to read, and it's not exactly clear what's going on everywhere.Extracting Utility FunctionsA good first step might be to break out a utility function to return a new object with updated fields.  There's also a repeated pattern with trying to update a specific item in an array that we could extract to a function:function updateObject(oldObject, newValues) {\n    // Encapsulate the idea of passing a new object as the first parameter\n    // to Object.assign to ensure we correctly copy data instead of mutating\n    return Object.assign({}, oldObject, newValues);\n}\n\nfunction updateItemInArray(array, itemId, updateItemCallback) {\n    const updatedItems = array.map(item => {\n        if(item.id !== itemId) {\n            // Since we only want to update one item, preserve all others as they are now\n            return item;\n        }\n\n        // Use the provided callback to create an updated item\n        const updatedItem = updateItemCallback(item);\n        return updatedItem;\n    });\n\n    return updatedItems;\n}\n\nfunction appReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' : { \n            return updateObject(state, {visibilityFilter : action.filter });\n        }\n        case 'ADD_TODO' : {\n            const newTodos = state.todos.concat({\n                id: action.id,\n                text: action.text,\n                completed: false\n            });\n\n            return updateObject(state, {todos : newTodos});\n        }\n        case 'TOGGLE_TODO' : {\n            const newTodos = updateItemInArray(state.todos, action.id, todo => {\n                return updateObject(todo, {completed : !todo.completed});\n            });\n\n            return updateObject(state, {todos : newTodos});\n        } \n        case 'EDIT_TODO' : {\n            const newTodos = updateItemInArray(state.todos, action.id, todo => {\n                return updateObject(todo, {text : action.text});\n            });\n\n            return updateObject(state, {todos : newTodos});\n        } \n        default : return state;\n    }\n}\nThat reduced the duplication and made things a bit easier to read.Extracting Case ReducersNext, we can split each specific case into its own function:// Omitted\nfunction updateObject(oldObject, newValues) {}\nfunction updateItemInArray(array, itemId, updateItemCallback) {}\n\n\nfunction setVisibilityFilter(state, action) {\n    return updateObject(state, {visibilityFilter : action.filter });\n}\n\nfunction addTodo(state, action) {\n    const newTodos = state.todos.concat({\n        id: action.id,\n        text: action.text,\n        completed: false\n    });\n\n    return updateObject(state, {todos : newTodos});\n}\n\nfunction toggleTodo(state, action) {\n    const newTodos = updateItemInArray(state.todos, action.id, todo => {\n        return updateObject(todo, {completed : !todo.completed});\n    });\n\n    return updateObject(state, {todos : newTodos});\n}\n\nfunction editTodo(state, action) {\n    const newTodos = updateItemInArray(state.todos, action.id, todo => {\n        return updateObject(todo, {text : action.text});\n    });\n\n    return updateObject(state, {todos : newTodos});\n}\n\nfunction appReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' : return setVisibilityFilter(state, action);\n        case 'ADD_TODO' : return addTodo(state, action);\n        case 'TOGGLE_TODO' : return toggleTodo(state, action);\n        case 'EDIT_TODO' : return editTodo(state, action);\n        default : return state;\n    }\n}\nNow it's very clear what's happening in each case.  We can also start to see some patterns emerging.Separating Data Handling by DomainOur app reducer is still aware of all the different cases for our application.  Let's try splitting things up so that the filter logic and the todo logic are separated:// Omitted\nfunction updateObject(oldObject, newValues) {}\nfunction updateItemInArray(array, itemId, updateItemCallback) {}\n\n\n\nfunction setVisibilityFilter(visibilityState, action) {\n    // Technically, we don't even care about the previous state\n    return action.filter;\n}\n\nfunction visibilityReducer(visibilityState = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' : return setVisibilityFilter(visibilityState, action);\n        default : return visibilityState;\n    }\n};\n\n\nfunction addTodo(todosState, action) {\n    const newTodos = todosState.concat({\n        id: action.id,\n        text: action.text,\n        completed: false\n    });\n\n    return newTodos;\n}\n\nfunction toggleTodo(todosState, action) {\n    const newTodos = updateItemInArray(todosState, action.id, todo => {\n        return updateObject(todo, {completed : !todo.completed});\n    });\n\n    return newTodos;\n}\n\nfunction editTodo(todosState, action) {\n    const newTodos = updateItemInArray(todosState, action.id, todo => {\n        return updateObject(todo, {text : action.text});\n    });\n\n    return newTodos;\n}\n\nfunction todosReducer(todosState = [], action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case 'ADD_TODO' : return addTodo(todosState, action);\n        case 'TOGGLE_TODO' : return toggleTodo(todosState, action);\n        case 'EDIT_TODO' : return editTodo(todosState, action);\n        default : return todosState;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction appReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    return {\n        todos : todosReducer(state.todos, action),\n        visibilityFilter : visibilityReducer(state.visibilityFilter, action)\n    };\n}\nNotice that because the two \"slice of state\" reducers are now getting only their own part of the whole state as arguments, they no longer need to return complex nested state objects, and are now simpler as a result.Reducing BoilerplateWe're almost done.  Since many people don't like switch statements, it's very common to use a function that creates a lookup table of action types to case functions.  We'll use the createReducer function described in Reducing Boilerplate:// Omitted\nfunction updateObject(oldObject, newValues) {}\nfunction updateItemInArray(array, itemId, updateItemCallback) {}\n\nfunction createReducer(initialState, handlers) {\n  return function reducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    if (handlers.hasOwnProperty(action.type)) {\n      return handlers[action.type](state, action)\n    } else {\n      return state\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n// Omitted\nfunction setVisibilityFilter(visibilityState, action) {}\n\nconst visibilityReducer = createReducer('SHOW_ALL', {\n    'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' : setVisibilityFilter\n});\n\n// Omitted\nfunction addTodo(todosState, action) {}\nfunction toggleTodo(todosState, action) {}\nfunction editTodo(todosState, action) {}\n\nconst todosReducer = createReducer([], {\n    'ADD_TODO' : addTodo,\n    'TOGGLE_TODO' : toggleTodo\n    'EDIT_TODO' : editTodo\n});\n\nfunction appReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    return {\n        todos : todosReducer(state.todos, action),\n        visibilityFilter : visibilityReducer(state.visibilityFilter, action)\n    };\n}\nCombining Reducers by SliceAs our last step, we can now use Redux's built-in combineReducers utility to handle the \"slice-of-state\" logic for our top-level app reducer.  Here's the final result:// Reusable utility functions\n\nfunction updateObject(oldObject, newValues) {\n    // Encapsulate the idea of passing a new object as the first parameter\n    // to Object.assign to ensure we correctly copy data instead of mutating\n    return Object.assign({}, oldObject, newValues);\n}\n\nfunction updateItemInArray(array, itemId, updateItemCallback) {\n    const updatedItems = array.map(item => {\n        if(item.id !== itemId) {\n            // Since we only want to update one item, preserve all others as they are now\n            return item;\n        }\n\n        // Use the provided callback to create an updated item\n        const updatedItem = updateItemCallback(item);\n        return updatedItem;\n    });\n\n    return updatedItems;\n}\n\nfunction createReducer(initialState, handlers) {\n  return function reducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    if (handlers.hasOwnProperty(action.type)) {\n      return handlers[action.type](state, action)\n    } else {\n      return state\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n// Handler for a specific case (\"case reducer\")\nfunction setVisibilityFilter(visibilityState, action) {\n    // Technically, we don't even care about the previous state\n    return action.filter;\n}\n\n// Handler for an entire slice of state (\"slice reducer\")\nconst visibilityReducer = createReducer('SHOW_ALL', {\n    'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' : setVisibilityFilter\n});\n\n// Case reducer\nfunction addTodo(todosState, action) {\n    const newTodos = todosState.concat({\n        id: action.id,\n        text: action.text,\n        completed: false\n    });\n\n    return newTodos;\n}\n\n// Case reducer\nfunction toggleTodo(todosState, action) {\n    const newTodos = updateItemInArray(todosState, action.id, todo => {\n        return updateObject(todo, {completed : !todo.completed});\n    });\n\n    return newTodos;\n}\n\n// Case reducer\nfunction editTodo(todosState, action) {\n    const newTodos = updateItemInArray(todosState, action.id, todo => {\n        return updateObject(todo, {text : action.text});\n    });\n\n    return newTodos;\n}\n\n// Slice reducer\nconst todosReducer = createReducer([], {\n    'ADD_TODO' : addTodo,\n    'TOGGLE_TODO' : toggleTodo\n    'EDIT_TODO' : editTodo\n});\n\n// \"Root reducer\"\nconst appReducer = combineReducers({\n    visibilityFilter : visibilityReducer,\n    todos : todosReducer\n});\nWe now have examples of several kinds of split-up reducer functions:  helper utilities like updateObject and createReducer, handlers for specific cases like setVisibilityFilter and addTodo, and slice-of-state handlers like visibilityReducer and todosReducer.  We also can see that appReducer is an example of a \"root reducer\".Although the final result in this example is noticeably longer than the original version, this is primarily due to the extraction of the utility functions, the addition of comments, and some deliberate verbosity for the sake of clarity, such as separate return statements.  Looking at each function individually, the amount of responsibility is now smaller, and the intent is hopefully clearer.  Also, in a real application, these functions would probably then be split into separate files such as reducerUtilities.js, visibilityReducer.js, todosReducer.js, and rootReducer.js."},"docs/recipes/reducers/UsingCombineReducers.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/UsingCombineReducers.html","title":"Using combineReducers","keywords":"","body":"Using combineReducersCore ConceptsThe most common state shape for a Redux app is a plain Javascript object containing \"slices\" of domain-specific data at each top-level key.  Similarly, the most common approach to writing reducer logic for that state shape is to have \"slice reducer\" functions, each with the same (state, action) signature, and each responsible for managing all updates to that specific slice of state.  Multiple slice reducers can respond to the same action, independently update their own slice as needed, and the updated slices are combined into the new state object.Because this pattern is so common, Redux provides the combineReducers utility to implement that behavior.  It is an example of a higher-order reducer, which takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and returns a new reducer function.There are several important ideas to be aware of when using combineReducers:First and foremost, combineReducers is simply a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux reducers.  You are not required to use it in your own application, and it does not handle every possible scenario.  It is entirely possible to write reducer logic without using it, and it is quite common to need to write custom reducer logic for cases that combineReducer does not handle.  (See Beyond combineReducers for examples and suggestions.)  \n\nWhile Redux itself is not opinionated about how your state is organized, combineReducers enforces several rules to help users avoid common errors.  (See combineReducers for details.)\n\nOne frequently asked question is whether Redux \"calls all reducers\" when dispatching an action.  Since there really is only one root reducer function, the default answer is \"no, it does not\".  However, combineReducers has specific behavior that does work that way.  In order to assemble the new state tree, combineReducers will call each slice reducer with its current slice of state and the current action, giving the slice reducer a chance to respond and update its slice of state if needed.  So, in that sense, using combineReducers does \"call all reducers\", or at least all of the slice reducers it is wrapping.\n\nYou can use it at all levels of your reducer structure, not just to create the root reducer.  It's very common to have multiple combined reducers in various places, which are composed together to create the root reducer.\n\nDefining State ShapeThere are two ways to define the initial shape and contents of your store's state.  First, the createStore function can take preloadedState as its second argument.  This is primarily intended for initializing the store with state that was previously persisted elsewhere, such as the browser's localStorage.  The other way is for the root reducer to return the initial state value when the state argument is undefined.  These two approaches are described in more detail in Initializing State, but there are some additional concerns to be aware of when using combineReducers.combineReducers takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and creates a function that outputs a corresponding state object with the same keys.  This means that if no preloaded state is provided to createStore, the naming of the keys in the input slice reducer object will define the naming of the keys in the output state object.  The correlation between these names is not always apparent, especially when using ES6 features such as default module exports and object literal shorthands.Here's an example of how use of ES6 object literal shorthand with combineReducers can define the state shape:// reducers.js\nexport default theDefaultReducer = (state = 0, action) => state;\n\nexport const firstNamedReducer = (state = 1, action) => state;\n\nexport const secondNamedReducer = (state = 2, action) => state;\n\n\n// rootReducer.js\nimport {combineReducers, createStore} from \"redux\";\n\nimport theDefaultReducer, {firstNamedReducer, secondNamedReducer} from \"./reducers\";\n\n// Use ES6 object literal shorthand syntax to define the object shape\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    theDefaultReducer,\n    firstNamedReducer,\n    secondNamedReducer\n});\n\nconst store = createStore(rootReducer);\nconsole.log(store.getState());\n// {theDefaultReducer : 0, firstNamedReducer : 1, secondNamedReducer : 2}\nNotice that because we used the ES6 shorthand for defining an object literal, the key names in the resulting state are the same as the variable names from the imports.  This may not always be the desired behavior, and is often a cause of confusion for those who aren't as familiar with ES6 syntax.Also, the resulting names are a bit odd.  It's generally not a good practice to actually include words like \"reducer\" in your state key names - the keys should simply reflect the domain or type of data they hold.  This means we should either explicitly specify the names of the keys in the slice reducer object to define the keys in the output state object, or carefully rename the variables for the imported slice reducers to set up the keys when using the shorthand object literal syntax.A better usage might look like:import {combineReducers, createStore} from \"redux\";\n\n// Rename the default import to whatever name we want. We can also rename a named import.\nimport defaultState, {firstNamedReducer, secondNamedReducer as secondState} from \"./reducers\";\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    defaultState,                   // key name same as the carefully renamed default export\n    firstState : firstNamedReducer, // specific key name instead of the variable name\n    secondState,                    // key name same as the carefully renamed named export\n});\n\nconst reducerInitializedStore = createStore(rootReducer);\nconsole.log(reducerInitializedStore.getState());\n// {defaultState : 0, firstState : 1, secondState : 2}\nThis state shape better reflects the data involved, because we took care to set up the keys we passed to combineReducers."},"docs/recipes/reducers/BeyondCombineReducers.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/BeyondCombineReducers.html","title":"Beyond combineReducers","keywords":"","body":"Beyond combineReducersThe combineReducers utility included with Redux is very useful, but is deliberately limited to handle a single common use case: updating a state tree that is a plain Javascript object, by delegating the work of updating each slice of state to a specific slice reducer.  It does not handle other use cases, such as a state tree made up of Immutable.js Maps, trying to pass other portions of the state tree as an additional argument to a slice reducer, or performing \"ordering\" of slice reducer calls.  It also does not care how a given slice reducer does its work.The common question, then, is \"How can I use combineReducers to handle these other use cases?\".  The answer to that is simply: \"you don't - you probably need to use something else\".  Once you go past the core use case for combineReducers, it's time to use more \"custom\" reducer logic, whether it be specific logic for a one-off use case, or a reusable function that could be widely shared.  Here's some suggestions for dealing with a couple of these typical use cases, but feel free to come up with your own approaches.Using slice reducers with Immutable.js objectsSince combineReducers currently only works with plain Javascript objects, an application that uses an Immutable.js Map object for the top of its state tree could not use combineReducers to manage that Map.  Since many developers do use Immutable.js, there are a number of published utilities that provide equivalent functionality, such as redux-immutable.  This package provides its own implementation of combineReducers that knows how to iterate over an Immutable Map instead of a plain Javascript object.Sharing data between slice reducersSimilarly, if sliceReducerA happens to need some data from sliceReducerB's slice of state in order to handle a particular action, or sliceReducerB happens to need the entire state as an argument, combineReducers does not handle that itself.  This could be resolved by writing a custom function that knows to pass the needed data as an additional argument in those specific cases, such as:function combinedReducer(state, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case \"A_TYPICAL_ACTION\" : {\n            return {\n                a : sliceReducerA(state.a, action),\n                b : sliceReducerB(state.b, action)\n            };\n        }\n        case \"SOME_SPECIAL_ACTION\" : {\n            return {\n                // specifically pass state.b as an additional argument\n                a : sliceReducerA(state.a, action, state.b),\n                b : sliceReducerB(state.b, action)\n            }        \n        }\n        case \"ANOTHER_SPECIAL_ACTION\" : {\n            return {\n                a : sliceReducerA(state.a, action),\n                // specifically pass the entire state as an additional argument\n                b : sliceReducerB(state.b, action, state)\n            }         \n        }    \n        default: return state;\n    }\n}\nAnother alternative to the \"shared-slice updates\" issue would be to simply put more data into the action.  This is easily accomplished using thunk functions or a similar approach, per this example:function someSpecialActionCreator() {\n    return (dispatch, getState) => {\n        const state = getState();\n        const dataFromB = selectImportantDataFromB(state);\n\n        dispatch({\n            type : \"SOME_SPECIAL_ACTION\",\n            payload : {\n                dataFromB\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\nBecause the data from B's slice is already in the action, the parent reducer doesn't have to do anything special to make that data available to sliceReducerA.A third approach would be to use the reducer generated by combineReducers to handle the \"simple\" cases where each slice reducer can update itself independently, but also use another reducer to handle the \"special\" cases where data needs to be shared across slices.  Then, a wrapping function could call both of those reducers in turn to generate the final result:const combinedReducer = combineReducers({\n    a : sliceReducerA,\n    b : sliceReducerB\n}); \n\nfunction crossSliceReducer(state, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case \"SOME_SPECIAL_ACTION\" : {\n            return {\n                // specifically pass state.b as an additional argument\n                a : handleSpecialCaseForA(state.a, action, state.b),\n                b : sliceReducerB(state.b, action)\n            }        \n        }\n        default : return state;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction rootReducer(state, action) {\n    const intermediateState = combinedReducer(state, action);\n    const finalState = crossSliceReducer(intermediateState, action);\n    return finalState;\n}\nAs it turns out, there's a useful utility called reduce-reducers that can make that process easier.  It simply takes multiple reducers and runs reduce() on them, passing the intermediate state values to the next reducer in line:// Same as the \"manual\" rootReducer above\nconst rootReducer = reduceReducers(combinedReducers, crossSliceReducer);\nNote that if you use reduceReducers, you should make sure that the first reducer in the list is able to define the initial state, since the later reducers will generally assume that the entire state already exists and not try to provide defaults.Further SuggestionsAgain, it's important to understand that Redux reducers are just functions.  While combineReducers is useful, it's just one tool in the toolbox.  Functions can contain conditional logic other than switch statements, functions can be composed to wrap each other, and functions can call other functions.  Maybe you need one of your slice reducers to be able to reset its state, and to only respond to specific actions overall.  You could do:const undoableFilteredSliceA = compose(undoReducer, filterReducer(\"ACTION_1\", \"ACTION_2\"), sliceReducerA);\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    a : undoableFilteredSliceA,\n    b : normalSliceReducerB\n});\nNote that combineReducers doesn't know or care that there's anything special about the reducer function that's responsible for managing a.  We didn't need to modify combineReducers to specifically know how to undo things - we just built up the pieces we needed into a new composed function.Also, while combineReducers is the one reducer utility function that's built into Redux, there's a wide variety of third-party reducer utilities that have published for reuse.  The Redux Addons Catalog lists many of the third-party utilities that are available.  Or, if none of the published utilities solve your use case, you can always write a function yourself that does just exactly what you need."},"docs/recipes/reducers/NormalizingStateShape.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/NormalizingStateShape.html","title":"Normalizing State Shape","keywords":"","body":"Normalizing State ShapeMany applications deal with data that is nested or relational in nature.  For example, a blog editor could have many Posts, each Post could have many Comments, and both Posts and Comments would be written by a User.  Data for this kind of application might look like:const blogPosts = [\n    {\n        id : \"post1\",\n        author : {username : \"user1\", name : \"User 1\"},\n        body : \"......\",\n        comments : [\n            {\n                id : \"comment1\",\n                author : {username : \"user2\", name : \"User 2\"},\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            {\n                id : \"comment2\",\n                author : {username : \"user3\", name : \"User 3\"},\n                comment : \".....\",\n            }\n        ]    \n    },\n    {\n        id : \"post2\",\n        author : {username : \"user2\", name : \"User 2\"},\n        body : \"......\",\n        comments : [\n            {\n                id : \"comment3\",\n                author : {username : \"user3\", name : \"User 3\"},\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            {\n                id : \"comment4\",\n                author : {username : \"user1\", name : \"User 1\"},\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            {\n                id : \"comment5\",\n                author : {username : \"user3\", name : \"User 3\"},\n                comment : \".....\",\n            }\n        ]    \n    }\n    // and repeat many times\n]\nNotice that the structure of the data is a bit complex, and some of the data is repeated.  This is a concern for several reasons:When a piece of data is duplicated in several places, it becomes harder to make sure that it is updated appropriately.\n\nNested data means that the corresponding reducer logic has to be more nested or more complex.  In particular, trying to update a deeply nested field can become very ugly very fast.\n\nSince immutable data updates require all ancestors in the state tree to be copied and updated as well, and new object references will cause connected UI components to re-render, an update to a deeply nested data object could force totally unrelated UI components to re-render even if the data they're displaying hasn't actually changed.\n\nBecause of this, the recommended approach to managing relational or nested data in a Redux store is to treat a portion of your store as if it were a database, and keep that data in a normalized form.Designing a Normalized StateThe basic concepts of normalizing data are:Each type of data gets its own \"table\" in the state.\n\nEach \"data table\" should store the individual items in an object, with the IDs of the items as keys and the items themselves as the values.\n\nAny references to individual items should be done by storing the item's ID.\n\nArrays of IDs should be used to indicate ordering.\n\nAn example of a normalized state structure for the blog example above might look like:{\n    posts : {\n        byId : {\n            \"post1\" : {\n                id : \"post1\",\n                author : \"user1\",\n                body : \"......\",\n                comments : [\"comment1\", \"comment2\"]    \n            },\n            \"post2\" : {\n                id : \"post2\",\n                author : \"user2\",\n                body : \"......\",\n                comments : [\"comment3\", \"comment4\", \"comment5\"]    \n            }\n        }\n        allIds : [\"post1\", \"post2\"]\n    },\n    comments : {\n        byId : {\n            \"comment1\" : {\n                id : \"comment1\",\n                author : \"user2\",\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            \"comment2\" : {\n                id : \"comment2\",\n                author : \"user3\",\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            \"comment3\" : {\n                id : \"comment3\",\n                author : \"user3\",\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            \"comment4\" : {\n                id : \"comment4\",\n                author : \"user1\",\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            \"comment5\" : {\n                id : \"comment5\",\n                author : \"user3\",\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n        },\n        allIds : [\"comment1\", \"comment2\", \"comment3\", \"commment4\", \"comment5\"]\n    },\n    users : {\n        byId : {\n            \"user1\" : {\n                username : \"user1\",\n                name : \"User 1\",\n            }\n            \"user2\" : {\n                username : \"user2\",\n                name : \"User 2\",\n            }\n            \"user3\" : {\n                username : \"user3\",\n                name : \"User 3\",\n            }\n        },\n        allIds : [\"user1\", \"user2\", \"user3\"]\n    }\n}\nThis state structure is much flatter overall.  Compared to the original nested format, this is an improvement in several ways:Because each each item is only defined in one place, we don't have to try to make changes in multiple places if that item is updated.\n\nThe reducer logic doesn't have to deal with deep levels of nesting, so it will probably be much simpler.\n\nThe logic for retrieving or updating a given item is now fairly simple and consistent.  Given an item's type and its ID, we can directly look it up in a couple simple steps, without having to dig through other objects to find it.\n\nSince each data type is separated, an update like changing the text of a comment would only require new copies of the \"comments > byId > comment\" portion of the tree.  This will generally mean fewer portions of the UI that need to update because their data has changed.  In contrast, updating a comment in the original nested shape would have required updating the the comment object, the parent post object, and the array of all post objects, and likely have caused all of the Post components and Comment components in the UI to re-render themselves.\n\nNote that a normalized state structure generally implies that more components are connected and each responsible for looking up their own data, as opposed to a few connected components looking up large amounts of data and passing all that data downwards.  As it turns out, having connected parent components simply pass item IDs to connected children is a good pattern for optimizing UI performance in a React Redux application, so keeping state normalized plays a key role in improving performance.Organizing Normalized Data in StateA typical application will likely have a mixture of relational data and non-relational data.  While there is no single rule for exactly how those different types of data should be organized, one common pattern is to put the relational \"tables\" under a common parent key, such as \"entities\".  A state structure using this approach might look like:{\n    simpleDomainData1: {....},\n    simpleDomainData2: {....}\n    entities : {\n        entityType1 : {....},\n        entityType2 : {....}\n    }\n    ui : {\n        uiSection1 : {....},\n        uiSection2 : {....}\n    }\n}\nThis could be expanded in a number of ways.  For example, an application that does a lot of editing of entities might want to keep two sets of \"tables\" in the state, one for the \"current\" item values and one for the \"work-in-progress\" item values.  When an item is edited, its values could be copied into the \"work-in-progress\" section, and any actions that update it would be applied to the \"work-in-progress\" copy, allowing the editing form to be controlled by that set of data while another part of the UI still refers to the original version.  \"Resetting\" the edit form would simply require removing the item from the \"work-in-progress\" section and re-copying the original data from \"current\" to \"work-in-progress\", while \"applying\" the edits would involve copying the values from the \"work-in-progress\" section to the \"current\" section.Relationships and TablesBecause we're treating a portion of our Redux store as a \"database\", many of the principles of database design also apply here as well.  For example, if we have a many-to-many relationship, we can model that using an intermediate table that stores the IDs of the corresponding items (often known as a \"join table\" or an \"associative table\").  For consistency, we would probably also want to use the same byId and allIds approach that we used for the actual item tables, like this:{\n    entities: {\n        authors : { byId : {}, allIds : [] },\n        books : { byId : {}, allIds : [] },\n        authorBook : {\n            byId : {\n                1 : {\n                    id : 1,\n                    authorId : 5,\n                    bookId : 22\n                },\n                2 : {\n                    id : 2,\n                    authorId : 5,\n                    bookId : 15,\n                }\n                3 : {\n                    id : 3,\n                    authorId : 42,\n                    bookId : 12\n                }\n            },\n            allIds : [1, 2, 3]\n\n        }\n    }\n}\nOperations like \"Look up all books by this author\" can then accomplished with a single loop over the join table.  Given the typical amounts of data in a client application and the speed of Javascript engines, this kind of operation is likely to have sufficiently fast performance for most use cases.Normalizing Nested DataBecause APIs frequently send back data in a nested form, that data needs to be transformed into a normalized shape before it can be included in the state tree.  The Normalizr library is usually used for this task.  You can define schema types and relations, feed the schema and the response data to Normalizr, and it will output a normalized transformation of the response.  That output can then be included in an action and used to update the store.  See the Normalizr documentation for more details on its usage."},"docs/recipes/reducers/UpdatingNormalizedData.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/UpdatingNormalizedData.html","title":"Updating Normalized Data","keywords":"","body":"Managing Normalized DataAs mentioned in Normalizing State Shape, the Normalizr library is frequently used to transform nested response data into a normalized shape suitable for integration into the store.  However, that doesn't address the issue of executing further updates to that normalized data as it's being used elsewhere in the application.  There are a variety of different approaches that you can use, based on your own preference.  We'll use the example of adding a new Comment to a Post.Standard ApproachesSimple MergingOne approach is to merge the contents of the action in to the existing state.  In this case, we need to do a deep recursive merge, not just a shallow copy.  The Lodash merge function can handle this for us:import merge from \"lodash/object/merge\";\n\nfunction commentsById(state = {}, action) {\n    default : {\n       if(action.entities && action.entities.comments) {\n           return merge({}, state, action.entities.comments.byId);\n       }\n       return state;\n    }\n}\nThis requires the least amount of work on the reducer side, but does require that the action creator potentially do a fair amount of work to organize the data into the correct shape before the action is dispatched.  It also doesn't handle trying to delete an item.Slice Reducer CompositionIf we have a nested tree of slice reducers, each slice reducer will need to know how to respond to this action appropriately.  We will need to include all the relevant data in the action.  We need to update the correct Post object with the comment's ID, create a new Comment object using that ID as a key, and include the Comment's ID in the list of all Comment IDs.  Here's how the pieces for this might fit together:// actions.js\nfunction addComment(postId, commentText) {\n    // Generate a unique ID for this comment\n    const commentId = generateId(\"comment\");\n\n    return {\n        type : \"ADD_COMMENT\",\n        payload : {\n            postId,\n            commentId,\n            commentText\n        }\n    };\n}\n\n\n// reducers/posts.js\nfunction addComment(state, action) {\n    const {payload} = action;\n    const {postId, commentId} = payload;\n\n    // Look up the correct post, to simplify the rest of the code\n    const post = state[postId];\n\n    return {\n        ...state,\n        // Update our Post object with a new \"comments\" array\n        [postId] : {\n             ...post,\n             comments : post.comments.concat(commentId)             \n        }\n    };\n}\n\nfunction postsById(state = {}, action) {\n    case \"ADD_COMMENT\" : return addComment(state, action);\n    default : return state;\n}\n\nfunction allPosts(state = [], action) {\n    // omitted - no work to be done for this example\n}\n\nconst postsReducer = combineReducers({\n    byId : postsById,\n    allIds : allPosts\n});\n\n\n// reducers/comments.js\nfunction addCommentEntry(state, action) {\n    const {payload} = action;\n    const {commentId, commentText} = payload;\n\n    // Create our new Comment object\n    const comment = {id : commentId, text : commentText};\n\n    // Insert the new Comment object into the updated lookup table\n    return {\n        ...state,\n        [commentId] : comment\n    };\n}\n\nfunction commentsById(state = {}, action) {\n    case \"ADD_COMMENT\" : return addCommentEntry(state, action);\n    default : return state;\n}\n\n\nfunction addCommentId(state, action) {\n    const {payload} = action;\n    const {commentId} = payload;\n    // Just append the new Comment's ID to the list of all IDs\n    return state.concat(commentId);\n}\n\nfunction allComments(state = [], action) {\n    case \"ADD_COMMENT\" : return addCommentId(state, action);\n    default : return state;\n}\n\nconst commentsReducer = combineReducers({\n    byId : commentsById,\n    allIds : allComments\n});\nThe example is a bit long, because it's showing how all the different slice reducers and case reducers fit together.  Note that the delegation involved here.  The postsById slice reducer delegates the work for this case to addComment, which inserts the new Comment's ID into the correct Post item.  Meanwhile, both the commentsById and allComments slice reducers have their own case reducers, which update the Comments lookup table and list of all Comment IDs appropriately.Other ApproachesTask-Based UpdatesSince reducers are just functions, there's an infinite number of ways to split up this logic.  While using slice reducers is obviously the most common, it's also possible to organize behavior in a more task-oriented structure.  Because this will often involve more nested updates, you may want to use an immutable update utility library like dot-prop-immutable or object-path-immutable to simplify the update statements.  Here's an example of what that might look like:import posts from \"./postsReducer\";\nimport comments from \"./commentsReducer\";\nimport dotProp from \"dot-prop-immutable\";\nimport {combineReducers} from \"redux\";\nimport reduceReducers from \"reduce-reducers\";\n\nconst combinedReducer = combineReducers({\n    posts,\n    comments\n});\n\n\nfunction addComment(state, action) {\n    const {payload} = action;\n    const {postId, commentId, commentText} = payload;\n\n    // State here is the entire combined state\n    const updatedWithPostState = dotProp.set(\n        state, \n        `posts.byId.${postId}.comments`, \n        comments => comments.concat(commentId)\n    );\n\n    const updatedWithCommentsTable = dotProp.set(\n        updatedWithPostState, \n        `comments.byId.${commentId}`,\n        {id : commentId, text : commentText}\n    );\n\n    const updatedWithCommentsList = dotProp.set(\n        updatedWithCommentsTable,\n        `comments.allIds`,\n        allIds => allIds.concat(commentId);\n    );\n\n    return updatedWithCommentsList;\n}\n\nconst featureReducers = createReducer({}, {\n    ADD_COMMENT : addComment,\n};\n\nconst rootReducer = reduceReducers(\n    combinedReducer,\n    featureReducers\n);\nThis approach makes it very clear what's happening for the \"ADD_COMMENTS\" case, but it does require nested updating logic, and some specific knowledge of the state tree shape.  Depending on how you want to compose your reducer logic, this may or may not be desired.Redux-ORMThe Redux-ORM library provides a very useful abstraction layer for managing normalized data in a Redux store.  It allows you to declare Model classes and define relations between them.  It can then generate the empty \"tables\" for your data types, act as a specialized selector tool for looking up the data, and perform immutable updates on that data.There's a couple ways Redux-ORM can be used to perform updates.  First, the Redux-ORM docs suggest defining reducer functions on each Model subclass, then including the auto-generated combined reducer function into your store:// models.js\nimport {Model, many, Schema} from \"redux-orm\";\n\nexport class Post extends Model {\n  static get fields() {\n    return {\n      // Define a many-sided relation - one Post can have many Comments, \n      // at a field named \"comments\"\n      comments : many(\"Comment\") \n    };\n  }\n\n  static reducer(state, action, Post) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n      case \"CREATE_POST\" : {\n        // Queue up the creation of a Post instance\n        Post.create(action.payload);\n        break;\n      }\n      case \"ADD_COMMENT\" : {\n        const {payload} = action;\n        const {postId, commentId} = payload;\n        // Queue up the addition of a relation between this Comment ID \n        // and this Post instance\n        Post.withId(postId).comments.add(commentId);\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Immutably apply updates to the Post section of state\n    return Post.getNextState();\n  }\n}\nPost.modelName = \"Post\";\n\nexport class Comment extends Model {\n  static get fields() {\n    return {};\n  }\n\n  static reducer(state, action, Comment) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n      case \"ADD_COMMENT\" : {\n        const {payload} = action;\n        const {commentId, commentText} = payload;\n\n        // Queue up the creation of a Comment instance\n        Comment.create({id : commentId, text : commentText});\n        break;\n      }   \n    }\n\n    // Immutably apply updates to the Comment section of state\n    return Comment.getNextState();\n  }\n}\nComment.modelName = \"Comment\";\n\n// Create a Schema instance, and hook up the Post and Comment models\nexport const schema = new Schema();\nschema.register(Post, Comment);\n\n\n// main.js\nimport { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux'\nimport {schema} from \"./models\";\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n  // Insert the auto-generated Redux-ORM reducer.  This will\n  // initialize our model \"tables\", and hook up the reducer\n  // logic we defined on each Model subclass\n  entities : schema.reducer()\n});\n\n// Dispatch an action to create a Post instance\nstore.dispatch({\n  type : \"CREATE_POST\",\n  payload : {\n    id : 1,\n    name : \"Test Post Please Ignore\" \n  }\n});\n\n// Dispatch an action to create a Comment instance as a child of that Post\nstore.dispatch({\n  type : \"ADD_COMMENT\",\n  payload : {\n    postId : 1,\n    commentId : 123,\n    commentText : \"This is a comment\"\n  }\n});\nThe Redux-ORM library maintains an internal queue of updates to be applied.  Those updates are then applied immutably, simplifying the update process.Another variation on this is to use Redux-ORM as an abstraction layer within a single case reducer:import {schema} from \"./models\";\n\n// Assume this case reducer is being used in our \"entities\" slice reducer, \n// and we do not have reducers defined on our Redux-ORM Model subclasses\nfunction addComment(entitiesState, action) {\n    const session = schema.from(entitiesState);\n    const {Post, Comment} = session;\n    const {payload} = action;\n    const {postId, commentId, commentText} = payload;\n\n    const post = Post.withId(postId);\n    post.comments.add(commentId);\n\n    Comment.create({id : commentId, text : commentText});\n\n    return session.reduce();\n}\nOverall, Redux-ORM provides a very useful set of abstractions for defining relations between data types, creating the \"tables\" in our state, retrieving and denormalizing relational data, and applying immutable updates to relational data."},"docs/recipes/reducers/ReusingReducerLogic.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/ReusingReducerLogic.html","title":"Reusing Reducer Logic","keywords":"","body":"Reusing Reducer LogicAs an application grows, common patterns in reducer logic will start to emerge.  You may find several parts of your reducer logic doing the same kinds of work for different types of data, and want to reduce duplication by reusing the same common logic for each data type.  Or, you may want to have multiple \"instances\" of a certain type of data being handled in the store.  However, the global structure of a Redux store comes with some trade-offs: it makes it easy to track the overall state of an application, but can also make it harder to \"target\" actions that need to update a specific piece of state, particularly if you are using combineReducers.As an example, let's say that we want to track multiple counters in our application, named A, B, and C.  We define our initial counter reducer, and we use combineReducers to set up our state:function counter(state = 0, action) {\n    switch (action.type) {\n        case 'INCREMENT':\n            return state + 1;\n        case 'DECREMENT':\n            return state - 1;\n        default:\n            return state;\n    }\n}\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    counterA : counter,\n    counterB : counter,\n    counterC : counter\n});\nUnfortunately, this setup has a problem.  Because combineReducers will call each slice reducer with the same action, dispatching {type : 'INCREMENT'} will actually cause all three counter values to be incremented, not just one of them.  We need some way to wrap the counter logic so that we can ensure that only the counter we care about is updated.Customizing Behavior with Higher-Order ReducersAs defined in Splitting Reducer Logic, a higher-order reducer is a function that takes a reducer function as an argument, and/or returns a new reducer function as a result.  It can also be viewed as a \"reducer factory\".  combineReducers is one example of a higher-order reducer.  We can use this pattern to create specialized versions of our own reducer functions, with each version only responding to specific actions.The two most common ways to specialize a reducer are to generate new action constants with a given prefix or suffix, or to attach additional info inside the action object.  Here's what those might look like:function createCounterWithNamedType(counterName = '') {\n    return function counter(state = 0, action) {\n        switch (action.type) {\n            case `INCREMENT_${counterName}`:\n                return state + 1;\n            case `DECREMENT_${counterName}`:\n                return state - 1;\n            default:\n                return state;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunction createCounterWithNameData(counterName = '') {\n    return function counter(state = 0, action) {\n        const {name} = action;\n        if(name !== counterName) return state;\n\n        switch (action.type) {\n            case `INCREMENT`:\n                return state + 1;\n            case `DECREMENT`:\n                return state - 1;\n            default:\n                return state;\n        }\n    }\n}\nWe should now be able to use either of these to generate our specialized counter reducers, and then dispatch actions that will affect the portion of the state that we care about:const rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    counterA : createCounterWithNamedType('A'),\n    counterB : createCounterWithNamedType('B'),\n    counterC : createCounterWithNamedType('C'),\n});\n\nstore.dispatch({type : 'INCREMENT_B'});\nconsole.log(store.getState());\n// {counterA : 0, counterB : 1, counterC : 0}\nWe could also vary the approach somewhat, and create a more generic higher-order reducer that accepts both a given reducer function and a name or identifier:function counter(state = 0, action) {\n    switch (action.type) {\n        case 'INCREMENT':\n            return state + 1;\n        case 'DECREMENT':\n            return state - 1;\n        default:\n            return state;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction createNamedWrapperReducer(reducerFunction, reducerName) {\n    return (state, action) => {\n        const {name} = action;\n        if(name !== reducerName) return state;\n\n        return reducerFunction(state, action);    \n    }\n}\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    counterA : createNamedWrapperReducer(counter, 'A'),\n    counterB : createNamedWrapperReducer(counter, 'B'),\n    counterC : createNamedWrapperReducer(counter, 'C'),\n});\nYou could even go as far as to make a generic filtering higher-order reducer:function createFilteredReducer(reducerFunction, reducerPredicate) {\n    return (state, action) => {\n        const shouldRunWrappedReducer = reducerPredicate(action);        \n        return shouldRunWrappedReducer ? reducerFunction(state, action) : state;    \n    }\n}\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    // check for suffixed strings\n    counterA : createFilteredReducer(counter, action => action.type.endsWith('_A')),\n    // check for extra data in the action\n    counterB : createFilteredReducer(counter, action => action.name === 'B'),\n    // respond to all 'INCREMENT' actions, but never 'DECREMENT'\n    counterC : createFilteredReducer(counter, action => action.type === 'INCREMENT')\n};\nThese basic patterns allow you to do things like having multiple instances of a smart connected component within the UI, or reuse common logic for generic capabilities such as pagination or sorting."},"docs/recipes/reducers/ImmutableUpdatePatterns.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/ImmutableUpdatePatterns.html","title":"Immutable Update Patterns","keywords":"","body":"Immutable Update PatternsThe articles listed in Prerequisite Concepts#Immutable Data Management give a number of good examples for how to perform basic update operations immutably, such as updating a field in an object or adding an item to the end of an array.  However, reducers will often need to use those basic operations in combination to perform more complicated tasks.  Here are some examples for some of the more common tasks you might have to implement.Updating Nested ObjectsThe key to updating nested data is that every level of nesting must be copied and updated appropriately.  This is often a difficult concept for those learning Redux, and there are some specific problems that frequently occur when trying to update nested objects.  These lead to accidental direct mutation, and should be avoided.Common Mistake #1: New variables that point to the same objectsDefining a new variable does not create a new actual object - it only creates another reference to the same object.  An example of this error would be:function updateNestedState(state, action) {\n    let nestedState = state.nestedState;\n    // ERROR: this directly modifies the existing object reference - don't do this!\n    nestedState.nestedField = action.data;\n\n    return {\n        ...state,\n        nestedState\n    };\n}\nThis function does correctly return a shallow copy of the top-level state object, but because the nestedState variable was still pointing at the existing object, the state was directly mutated.Common Mistake #2: Only making a shallow copy of one levelAnother common version of this error looks like this:function updateNestedState(state, action) {\n    // Problem: this only does a shallow copy!\n    let newState = {...state};\n\n    // ERROR: nestedState is still the same object!\n    newState.nestedState.nestedField = action.data;\n\n    return newState;\n}\nDoing a shallow copy of the top level is not sufficient - the nestedState object should be copied as well.Correct Approach: Copying All Levels of Nested DataUnfortunately, the process of correctly applying immutable updates to deeply nested state can easily become verbose and hard to read.  Here's what an example of updating state.first.second[someId].fourth might look like:function updateVeryNestedField(state, action) {\n    return {\n        ....state,\n        first : {\n            ...state.first,\n            second : {\n                ...state.first.second,\n                [action.someId] : {\n                    ...state.first.second[action.someId],\n                    fourth : action.someValue\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nObviously, each layer of nesting makes this harder to read, and gives more chances to make mistakes.  This is one of several reasons why you are encouraged to keep your state flattened, and compose reducers as much as possible.Inserting and Removing Items in ArraysNormally, a Javascript array's contents are modified using mutative functions like push, unshift, and splice.  Since we don't want to mutate state directly in reducers, those should normally be avoided.  Because of that, you might see \"insert\" or \"remove\" behavior written like this:function insertItem(array, action) {\n    return [\n        ...array.slice(0, action.index),\n        action.item,\n        ...array.slice(action.index)\n    ]\n}\n\nfunction removeItem(array, action) {\n    return [\n        ...array.slice(0, action.index),\n        ...array.slice(action.index + 1)\n    ];\n}\nHowever, remember that the key is that the original in-memory reference is not modified.  As long as we make a copy first, we can safely mutate the copy.  Note that this is true for both arrays and objects, but nested values still must be updated using the same rules.This means that we could also write the insert and remove functions like this:function insertItem(array, action) {\n    let newArray = array.slice();\n    newArray.splice(action.index, 0, action.item);\n    return newArray;\n}\n\nfunction removeItem(array, action) {\n    let newArray = array.slice();\n    newArray.splice(action.index, 1);\n    return newArray;\n}\nThe remove function could also be implemented as:function removeItem(array, action) {\n    return array.filter( (item, index) => index !== action.index);\n}\nUpdating an Item in an ArrayUpdating one item in an array can be accomplished by using Array.map, returning a new value for the item we want to update, and returning the existing values for all other items:function updateObjectInArray(array, action) {\n    return array.map( (item, index) => {\n        if(index !== action.index) {\n            // This isn't the item we care about - keep it as-is\n            return item;\n        }\n\n        // Otherwise, this is the one we want - return an updated value\n        return {\n            ...item,\n            ...action.item\n        };    \n    });\n}\nImmutable Update Utility LibrariesBecause writing immutable update code can become tedious, there are a number of utility libraries that try to abstract out the process.  These libraries vary in APIs and usage, but all try to provide a shorter and more succinct way of writing these updates.  Some, like dot-prop-immutable, take string paths for commands:state = dotProp.set(state, `todos.${index}.complete`, true)\nOthers, like immutability-helper (a fork of the now-deprecated React Immutability Helpers addon), use nested values and helper functions:var collection = [1, 2, {a: [12, 17, 15]}];\nvar newCollection = update(collection, {2: {a: {$splice: [[1, 1, 13, 14]]}}});\nThey can provide a useful alternative to writing manual immutable update logic.A list of many immutable update utilities can be found in the Immutable Data#Immutable Update Utilities section of the Redux Addons Catalog."},"docs/recipes/reducers/InitializingState.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/InitializingState.html","title":"Initializing State","keywords":"","body":"Initializing StateThere are two main ways to initialize state for your application.  The createStore method can accept an optional preloadedState value is its second argument.  Reducers can also specify an initial value by looking for an incoming state argument that is undefined, and returning the value they'd like to use as a default.  This can either be done with an explicit check inside the reducer, or by using the ES6 default argument value syntax: function myReducer(state = someDefaultValue, action).It's not always immediately clear how these two approaches interact.  Fortunately, the process does follow some predictable rules.  Here's how the pieces fit together.SummaryWithout combineReducers() or similar manual code, preloadedState always wins over state = ... in the reducer because the state passed to the reducer is preloadedState and is not undefined, so the ES6 argument syntax doesn't apply.With combineReducers() the behavior is more nuanced. Those reducers whose state is specified in preloadedState will receive that state. Other reducers will receive undefined and because of that will fall back to the state = ... default argument they specify.In general, preloadedState wins over the state specified by the reducer. This lets reducers specify initial data that makes sense to them as default arguments, but also allows loading existing data (fully or partially) when you're hydrating the store from some persistent storage or the server.In DepthSingle Simple ReducerFirst let's consider a case where you have a single reducer.  Say you don't use combineReducers().Then your reducer might look like this:function counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n  case 'INCREMENT': return state + 1;\n  case 'DECREMENT': return state - 1;\n  default: return state;\n  }\n}\nNow let's say you create a store with it.import { createStore } from 'redux';\nlet store = createStore(counter);\nconsole.log(store.getState()); // 0\nThe initial state is zero. Why?   Because the second argument to createStore was undefined. This is the state passed to your reducer the first time. When Redux initializes it dispatches a \"dummy\" action to fill the state. So your counter reducer was called with state equal to undefined. This is exactly the case that \"activates\" the default argument. Therefore, state is now 0 as per the default state value (state = 0). This state (0) will be returned.Let's consider a different scenario:import { createStore } from 'redux';\nlet store = createStore(counter, 42);\nconsole.log(store.getState()); // 42\nWhy is it 42, and not 0, this time? Because createStore was called with 42 as the second argument. This argument becomes the state passed to your reducer along with the dummy action. This time, state is not undefined (it's 42!), so ES6 default argument syntax has no effect. The state is 42, and 42 is returned from the reducer.Combined ReducersNow let's consider a case where you use combineReducers().You have two reducers:function a(state = 'lol', action) {\n  return state;\n}\n\nfunction b(state = 'wat', action) {\n  return state;\n}\nThe reducer generated by combineReducers({ a, b }) looks like this:// const combined = combineReducers({ a, b })\nfunction combined(state = {}, action) {\n  return {\n    a: a(state.a, action),\n    b: b(state.b, action)\n  };\n}\nIf we call createStore without the preloadedState, it's going to initialize the state to {}. Therefore, state.a and state.b will be undefined by the time it calls a and b reducers. Both a and b reducers will receive undefined as their state arguments, and if they specify default state values, those will be returned. This is how the combined reducer returns a { a: 'lol', b: 'wat' } state object on the first invocation.import { createStore } from 'redux';\nlet store = createStore(combined);\nconsole.log(store.getState()); // { a: 'lol', b: 'wat' }\nLet's consider a different scenario:import { createStore } from 'redux';\nlet store = createStore(combined, { a: 'horse' });\nconsole.log(store.getState()); // { a: 'horse', b: 'wat' }\nNow I specified the preloadedState as the argument to createStore(). The state returned from the combined reducer combines the initial state I specified for the a reducer with the 'wat' default argument specified that b reducer chose itself.Let's recall what the combined reducer does:// const combined = combineReducers({ a, b })\nfunction combined(state = {}, action) {\n  return {\n    a: a(state.a, action),\n    b: b(state.b, action)\n  };\n}\nIn this case, state was specified so it didn't fall back to {}. It was an object with a field equal to 'horse', but without the b field. This is why the a reducer received 'horse' as its state and gladly returned it, but the b reducer received undefined as its state and thus returned its idea of the default state (in our example, 'wat'). This is how we get { a: 'horse', b: 'wat' } in return.RecapTo sum this up, if you stick to Redux conventions and return the initial state from reducers when they're called with undefined as the state argument (the easiest way to implement this is to specify the state ES6 default argument value), you're going to have a nice useful behavior for combined reducers. They will prefer the corresponding value in the preloadedState object you pass to the createStore() function, but if you didn't pass any, or if the corresponding field is not set, the default state argument specified by the reducer is chosen instead. This approach works well because it provides both initialization and hydration of existing data, but lets individual reducers reset their state if their data was not preserved. Of course you can apply this pattern recursively, as you can use combineReducers() on many levels, or even compose reducers manually by calling reducers and giving them the relevant part of the state tree."},"docs/FAQ.html":{"url":"docs/FAQ.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"Redux FAQTable of ContentsGeneralWhen should I use Redux? \n\nCan Redux only be used with React? \n\nDo I need to have a particular build tool to use Redux? \n\n\nReducersHow do I share state between two reducers?

The most common usage is with React and React Native, but there are bindings available for Angular, Angular 2, Vue, Mithril, and more. Redux simply provides a subscription mechanism which can be used by any other code. That said it is most useful when combined with a declarative view implementation that can infer the UI updates from the state changes.Do I need to have a particular build tool to use Redux?Redux is originally written in ES6 and transpiled for production into ES5 with Webpack and Babel. You should be able to use it regardless of your JavaScript build process. Redux also offers a UMD build that can be used directly without any build process at all. The counter-vanilla example demonstrates basic ES5 usage with Redux included as a  tag. As the relevant pull request says:The new Counter Vanilla example is aimed to dispel the myth that Redux requires Webpack, React, hot reloading, sagas, action creators, constants, Babel, npm, CSS modules, decorators, fluent Latin, an Egghead subscription, a PhD, or an Exceeds Expectations O.W.L. level.Nope, it's just HTML, some artisanal  tags, and plain old DOM manipulation. Enjoy!ReducersHow do I share state between two reducers? Do I have to use combineReducers?The suggested structure for a Redux store is to split the state object into multiple “slices” or “domains” by key, and provide a separate reducer function to manage each individual data slice. This is similar to how the standard Flux pattern has multiple independent stores, and Redux provides the combineReducers utility function to make this pattern easier. However, it's important to note that combineReducers is not required—it is simply a utility function for the common use case of having a single reducer function per state slice, with plain JavaScript objects for the data.Many users later want to try to share data between two reducers, but find that combineReducers does not allow them to do so. There are several approaches that can be used:If a reducer needs to know data from another slice of state, the state tree shape may need to be reorganized so that a single reducer is handling more of the data.\n\nYou may need to write some custom functions for handling some of these actions. This may require replacing combineReducers with your own top-level reducer function. You can also use a utility such as reduce-reducers to run combineReducers to handle most actions, but also run a more specialized reducer for specific actions that cross state slices.\n\nAsync action creators such as redux-thunk have access to the entire state through getState(). An action creator can retrieve additional data from the state and put it in an action, so that each reducer has enough information to update its own state slice.\n\nIn general, remember that reducers are just functions—you can organize them and subdivide them any way you want, and you are encouraged to break them down into smaller, reusable functions (“reducer composition”). While you do so, you may pass a custom third argument from a parent reducer if a child reducer needs additional data to calculate its next state. You just need to make sure that together they follow the basic rules of reducers: (state, action) => newState, and update state immutably rather than mutating it directly.Further informationDocumentationAPI: combineReducers\n\nDiscussions#601: A concern on combineReducers, when an action is related to multiple reducers\n\n#1400: Is passing top-level state object to branch reducer an anti-pattern?\n\nStack Overflow: Accessing other parts of the state when using combined reducers?\n\nStack Overflow: Reducing an entire subtree with redux combineReducers\n\nSharing State Between Redux Reducers\n\nDo I have to use the switch statement to handle actions?No. You are welcome to use any approach you'd like to respond to an action in a reducer.

Should I ever use React's setState()?There is no “right” answer for this. Some users prefer to keep every single piece of data in Redux, to maintain a fully serializable and controlled version of their application at all times. Others prefer to keep non-critical or UI state, such as “is this dropdown currently open”, inside a component's internal state. Find a balance that works for you, and go with it.There are a number of community packages that implement various approaches for storing per-component state in a Redux store instead, such as redux-ui, redux-component, redux-react-local, and more.Further informationDiscussions#159: Investigate using Redux for pseudo-local component state\n\n#1098: Using Redux in reusable React component\n\n#1287: How to choose between Redux's store and React's state?\n\n#1385: What are the disadvantages of storing all your state in a single immutable atom?\n\nStack Overflow: Why is state all in one place, even state that isn't global?\n\nStack Overflow: Should all component state be kept in Redux store?\n\nCan I put functions, promises, or other non-serializable items in my store state?It is highly recommended that you only put plain serializable objects, arrays, and primitives into your store. It's technically possible to insert non-serializable items into the store, but doing so can break the ability to persist and rehydrate the contents of a store.Further informationDiscussions#1248: Is it ok and possible to store a react component in a reducer?\n\n#1279: Have any suggestions for where to put a Map Component in Flux?\n\n#1390: Component Loading\n\n#1407: Just sharing a great base class\n\nHow do I organize nested or duplicate data in my state?Data with IDs, nesting, or relationships should generally be stored in a “normalized” fashion: each object should be stored once, keyed by ID, and other objects that reference it should only store the ID rather than a copy of the entire object. It may help to think of parts of your store as a database, with individual “tables” per item type. Libraries such as normalizr and redux-orm can provide help and abstractions in managing normalized data.Further informationDocumentationAdvanced: Async Actions\n\nExamples: Real World example\n\nDiscussions#316: How to create nested reducers?\n\n#815: Working with Data Structures\n\n#946: Best way to update related state fields with split reducers?\n\n#994: How to cut the boilerplate when updating nested entities?\n\n#1255: Normalizr usage with nested objects in React/Redux\n\nTwitter: state shape should be normalized\n\nStore SetupCan or should I create multiple stores? Can I import my store directly, and use it in components myself?The original Flux pattern describes having multiple “stores” in an app, each one holding a different area of domain data. This can introduce issues such as needing to have one store “waitFor” another store to update. This is not necessary in Redux because the separation between data domains is already achieved by splitting a single reducer into smaller reducers.As with several other questions, it is possible to create multiple distinct Redux stores in a page, but the intended pattern is to have only a single store. Having a single store enables using the Redux DevTools, makes persisting and rehydrating data simpler, and simplifies the subscription logic.Some valid reasons for using multiple stores in Redux might include:Solving a performance issue caused by too frequent updates of some part of the state, when confirmed by profiling the app.\n\nIsolating a Redux app as a component in a bigger application, in which case you might want to create a store per root component instance.\n\nHowever, creating new stores shouldn't be your first instinct, especially if you come from a Flux background. Try reducer composition first, and only use multiple stores if it doesn't solve your problem.Similarly, while you can reference your store instance by importing it directly, this is not a recommended pattern in Redux. If you create a store instance and export it from a module, it will become a singleton. This means it will be harder to isolate a Redux app as a component of a larger app, if this is ever necessary, or to enable server rendering, because on the server you want to create separate store instances for every request.With React Redux, the wrapper classes generated by the connect() function do actually look for props.store if it exists, but it's best if you wrap your root component in  and let React Redux worry about passing the store down. This way components don't need to worry about importing a store module, and isolating a Redux app or enabling server rendering is much easier to do later.Further informationDocumentationAPI: Store\n\nDiscussions#1346: Is it bad practice to just have a 'stores' directory?\n\nStack Overflow: Redux multiple stores, why not?\n\nStack Overflow: Accessing Redux state in an action creator\n\nGist: Breaking out of Redux paradigm to isolate apps\n\nIs it OK to have more than one middleware chain in my store enhancer? What is the difference between next and dispatch in a middleware function?Redux middleware act like a linked list. Each middleware function can either call next(action) to pass an action along to the next middleware in line, call dispatch(action) to restart the processing at the beginning of the list, or do nothing at all to stop the action from being processed further.This chain of middleware is defined by the arguments passed to the applyMiddleware function used when creating a store. Defining multiple chains will not work correctly, as they would have distinctly different dispatch references and the different chains would effectively be disconnected.Further informationDocumentationAdvanced: Middleware\n\nAPI: applyMiddleware\n\nDiscussions#1051: Shortcomings of the current applyMiddleware and composing createStore\n\nUnderstanding Redux Middleware\n\nExploring Redux Middleware\n\nHow do I subscribe to only a portion of the state? Can I get the dispatched action as part of the subscription?Redux provides a single store.subscribe method for notifying listeners that the store has updated. Listener callbacks do not receive the current state as an argument—it is simply an indication that something has changed. The subscriber logic can then call getState() to get the current state value.This API is intended as a low-level primitive with no dependencies or complications, and can be used to build higher-level subscription logic. UI bindings such as React Redux can create a subscription for each connected component. It is also possible to write functions that can intelligently compare the old state vs the new state, and execute additional logic if certain pieces have changed. Examples include redux-watch and redux-subscribe which offer different approaches to specifying subscriptions and handling changes.The new state is not passed to the listeners in order to simplify implementing store enhancers such as the Redux DevTools. In addition, subscribers are intended to react to the state value itself, not the action. Middleware can be used if the action is important and needs to be handled specifically.Further informationDocumentationBasics: Store\n\nAPI: Store\n\nDiscussions#303: subscribe API with state as an argument\n\n#580: Is it possible to get action and state in store.subscribe?\n\n#922: Proposal: add subscribe to middleware API\n\n#1057: subscribe listener can get action param?\n\n#1300: Redux is great but major feature is missing\n\nActionsWhy should type be a string, or at least serializable? Why should my action types be constants?As with state, serializable actions enable several of Redux's defining features, such as time travel debugging, and recording and replaying actions. Using something like a Symbol for the type value or using instanceof checks for actions themselves would break that. Strings are serializable and easily self-descriptive, and so are a better choice. Note that it is okay to use Symbols, Promises, or other non-serializable values in an action if the action is intended for use by middleware. Actions only need to be serializable by the time they actually reach the store and are passed to the reducers.We can't reliably enforce serializable actions for performance reasons, so Redux only checks that every action is a plain object, and that the type is defined. The rest is up to you, but you might find that keeping everything serializable helps debug and reproduce issues.Encapsulating and centralizing commonly used pieces of code is a key concept in programming. While it is certainly possible to manually create action objects everywhere, and write each type value by hand, defining reusable constants makes maintaining code easier. If you put constants in a separate file, you can check your import statements against typos so you can't accidentally use the wrong string.Further informationDocumentationReducing Boilerplate\n\nDiscussion#384: Recommend that Action constants be named in the past tense\n\n#628: Solution for simple action creation with less boilerplate\n\n#1024: Proposal: Declarative reducers\n\n#1167: Reducer without switch\n\nStack Overflow: Why do you need 'Actions' as data in Redux?\n\nStack Overflow: What is the point of the constants in Redux?\n\nIs there always a one-to-one mapping between reducers and actions?No. We suggest you write independent small reducer functions that are each responsible for updates to a specific slice of state. We call this pattern “reducer composition”. A given action could be handled by all, some, or none of them. This keeps components decoupled from the actual data changes, as one action may affect different parts of the state tree, and there is no need for the component to be aware of this. Some users do choose to bind them more tightly together, such as the “ducks” file structure, but there is definitely no one-to-one mapping by default, and you should break out of such a paradigm any time you feel you want to handle an action in many reducers.Further informationDocumentationBasics: Reducers\n\nDiscussionsTwitter: most common Redux misconception\n\n#1167: Reducer without switch\n\nReduxible #8: Reducers and action creators aren't a one-to-one mapping\n\nStack Overflow: Can I dispatch multiple actions without Redux Thunk middleware?\n\nHow can I represent “side effects” such as AJAX calls? Why do we need things like “action creators”, “thunks”, and “middleware” to do async behavior?This is a long and complex topic, with a wide variety of opinions on how code should be organized and what approaches should be used.Any meaningful web app needs to execute complex logic, usually including asynchronous work such as making AJAX requests. That code is no longer purely a function of its inputs, and the interactions with the outside world are known as “side effects”Redux is inspired by functional programming, and out of the box, has no place for side effects to be executed. In particular, reducer functions must always be pure functions of (state, action) => newState. However, Redux's middleware makes it possible to intercept dispatched actions and add additional complex behavior around them, including side effects.In general, Redux suggests that code with side effects should be part of the action creation process. While that logic can be performed inside of a UI component, it generally makes sense to extract that logic into a reusable function so that the same logic can be called from multiple places—in other words, an action creator function.The simplest and most common way to do this is to add the Redux Thunk middleware that lets you write action creators with more complex and asynchronous logic. Another widely-used method is Redux Saga which lets you write more synchronous-looking code using generators, and can act like “background threads” or “daemons” in a Redux app. Yet another approach is Redux Loop, which inverts the process by allowing your reducers to declare side effects in response to state changes and have them executed separately. Beyond that, there are many other community-developed libraries and ideas, each with their own take on how side effects should be managed.Further informationDocumentationAdvanced: Async Actions\n\nAdvanced: Async Flow\n\nAdvanced: Middleware\n\nDiscussions#291: Trying to put API calls in the right place\n\n#455: Modeling side effects\n\n#533: Simpler introduction to async action creators\n\n#569: Proposal: API for explicit side effects\n\n#1139: An alternative side effect model based on generators and sagas\n\nStack Overflow: Why do we need middleware for async flow in Redux?\n\nStack Overflow: How to dispatch a Redux action with a timeout?\n\nStack Overflow: Where should I put synchronous side effects linked to actions in redux?\n\nStack Overflow: How to handle complex side-effects in Redux?\n\nStack Overflow: How to unit test async Redux actions to mock ajax response\n\nStack Overflow: How to fire AJAX calls in response to the state changes with Redux?\n\nReddit: Help performing Async API calls with Redux-Promise Middleware.\n\nTwitter: possible comparison between sagas, loops, and other approaches\n\nRedux Side-Effects and You\n\nPure functionality and side effects in Redux\n\nShould I dispatch multiple actions in a row from one action creator?There's no specific rule for how you should structure your actions. Using an async middleware like Redux Thunk certainly enables scenarios such as dispatching multiple distinct but related actions in a row, dispatching actions to represent progression of an AJAX request, dispatching actions conditionally based on state, or even dispatching an action and checking the updated state immediately afterwards.In general, ask if these actions are related but independent, or should actually be represented as one action. Do what makes sense for your own situation but try to balance the readability of reducers with readability of the action log. For example, an action that includes the whole new state tree would make your reducer a one-liner, but the downside is now you have no history of why the changes are happening, so debugging gets really difficult. On the other hand, if you emit actions in a loop to keep them granular, it's a sign that you might want to introduce a new action type that is handled in a different way.Try to avoid dispatching several times synchronously in a row in the places where you're concerned about performance. If you use React, note that you can improve performance of multiple synchronous dispatches by wrapping them in ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates(), but this API is experimental and may be removed in any React release so don't rely on it too heavily. Take a look at redux-batched-actions that lets you dispatch several actions as if it was one and “unpack” them in the reducer, and redux-batched-subscribe which lets you debounce subscriber calls for multiple dispatches.Further informationDiscussions#597: Valid to dispatch multiple actions from an event handler?\n\n#959: Multiple actions one dispatch?\n\nStack Overflow: Should I use one or several action types to represent this async action?\n\nStack Overflow: Do events and actions have a 1:1 relationship in Redux?\n\nStack Overflow: Should actions be handled by reducers to related actions or generated by action creators themselves?\n\nCode StructureWhat should my file structure look like? How should I group my action creators and reducers in my project? Where should my selectors go?Since Redux is just a data store library, it has no direct opinion on how your project should be structured. However, there are a few common patterns that most Redux developers tend to use:Rails-style: separate folders for “actions”, “constants”, “reducers”, “containers”, and “components”\n\nDomain-style: separate folders per feature or domain, possibly with sub-folders per file type\n\n“Ducks”: similar to domain style, but explicitly tying together actions and reducers, often by defining them in the same file\n\nIt's generally suggested that selectors are defined alongside reducers and exported, and then reused elsewhere (such as in mapStateToProps functions, in async action creators, or sagas) to colocate all the code that knows about the actual shape of the state tree in the reducer files.Further informationDiscussions#839: Emphasize defining selectors alongside reducers\n\n#943: Reducer querying\n\nReact Boilerplate #27: Application Structure\n\nStack Overflow: How to structure Redux components/containers\n\nRedux Best Practices\n\nRules For Structuring (Redux) Applications \n\nA Better File Structure for React/Redux Applications\n\nOrganizing Large React Applications\n\nFour Strategies for Organizing Code\n\nHow should I split my logic between reducers and action creators? Where should my “business logic” go?There's no single clear answer to exactly what pieces of logic should go in a reducer or an action creator. Some developers prefer to have “fat” action creators, with “thin” reducers that simply take the data in an action and blindly merge it into the corresponding state. Others try to emphasize keeping actions as small as possible, and minimize the usage of getState() in an action creator.This comment sums up the dichotomy nicely:Now, the problem is what to put in the action creator and what in the reducer, the choice between fat and thin action objects. If you put all the logic in the action creator, you end up with fat action objects that basically declare the updates to the state. Reducers become pure, dumb, add-this, remove that, update these functions. They will be easy to compose. But not much of your business logic will be there.\nIf you put more logic in the reducer, you end up with nice, thin action objects, most of your data logic in one place, but your reducers are harder to compose since you might need info from other branches. You end up with large reducers or reducers that take additional arguments from higher up in the state.Find the balance between these two extremes, and you will master Redux.Further informationDiscussions#1165: Where to put business logic / validation?\n\n#1171: Recommendations for best practices regarding action-creators, reducers, and selectors\n\nStack Overflow: Accessing Redux state in an action creator?\n\nPerformanceHow well does Redux “scale” in terms of performance and architecture?While there's no single definitive answer to this, most of the time this should not be a concern in either case.The work done by Redux generally falls into a few areas: processing actions in middleware and reducers (including object duplication for immutable updates), notifying subscribers after actions are dispatched, and updating UI components based on the state changes. While it's certainly possible for each of these to become a performance concern in sufficiently complex situations, there's nothing inherently slow or inefficient about how Redux is implemented. In fact, React Redux in particular is heavily optimized to cut down on unnecessary re-renders.As for architecture, anecdotal evidence is that Redux works well for varying project and team sizes. Redux is currently used by hundreds of companies and thousands of developers, with several hundred thousand monthly installations from NPM. One developer reported:for scale, we have ~500 action types, ~400 reducer cases, ~150 components, 5 middlewares, ~200 actions, ~2300 testsFurther informationDiscussions#310: Who uses Redux?\n\nReddit: What's the best place to keep the initial state?\n\nReddit: Help designing Redux state for a single page app\n\nReddit: Redux performance issues with a large state object?\n\nReddit: React/Redux for Ultra Large Scale apps\n\nTwitter: Redux scaling\n\nWon't calling “all my reducers” for each action be slow?It's important to note that a Redux store really only has a single reducer function. The store passes the current state and dispatched action to that one reducer function, and lets the reducer handle things appropriately.Obviously, trying to handle every possible action in a single function does not scale well, simply in terms of function size and readability, so it makes sense to split the actual work into separate functions that can be called by the top-level reducer. In particular, the common suggested pattern is to have a separate sub-reducer function that is responsible for managing updates to a particular slice of state at a specific key. The combineReducers() that comes with Redux is one of the many possible ways to achieve this. It's also highly suggested to keep your store state as flat and as normalized as possible. Ultimately, though, you are in charge of organizing your reducer logic any way you want.However, even if you happen to have many different independent sub-reducers, and even have deeply nested state, reducer speed is unlikely to be a problem. JavaScript engines are capable of running a very large number of function calls per second, and most of your sub-reducers are probably just using a switch statement and returning the existing state by default in response to most actions.If you actually are concerned about reducer performance, you can use a utility such as redux-ignore or reduxr-scoped-reducer to ensure that only certain reducers listen to specific actions. You can also use redux-log-slow-reducers to do some performance benchmarking.Further informationDiscussions#912: Proposal: action filter utility\n\n#1303: Redux Performance with Large Store and frequent updates\n\nStack Overflow: State in Redux app has the name of the reducer\n\nStack Overflow: How does Redux deal with deeply nested models?\n\nDo I have to deep-clone my state in a reducer? Isn't copying my state going to be slow?Immutably updating state generally means making shallow copies, not deep copies. Shallow copies are much faster than deep copies, because fewer objects and fields have to be copied, and it effectively comes down to moving some pointers around.However, you do need to create a copied and updated object for each level of nesting that is affected. Although that shouldn't be particularly expensive, it's another good reason why you should keep your state normalized and shallow if possible.Common Redux misconception: you need to deeply clone the state. Reality: if something inside doesn't change, keep its reference the same!Further informationDiscussions#454: Handling big states in reducer\n\n#758: Why can't state be mutated?\n\n#994: How to cut the boilerplate when updating nested entities?\n\nTwitter: common misconception - deep cloning\n\nCloning Objects in JavaScript\n\nHow can I reduce the number of store update events?Redux notifies subscribers after each successfully dispatched action (i.e. an action reached the store and was handled by reducers). In some cases, it may be useful to cut down on the number of times subscribers are called, particularly if an action creator dispatches multiple distinct actions in a row. There are a number of community add-ons that provide batching of subscription notifications when multiple actions are dispatched, such as redux-batched-subscribe and redux-batched-actions.Further informationDiscussions#125: Strategy for avoiding cascading renders\n\n#542: Idea: batching actions\n\n#911: Batching actions\n\nReact Redux #263: Huge performance issue when dispatching hundreds of actions\n\nWill having “one state tree” cause memory problems? Will dispatching many actions take up memory?First, in terms of raw memory usage, Redux is no different than any other JavaScript library. The only difference is that all the various object references are nested together into one tree, instead of maybe saved in various independent model instances such as in Backbone. Second, a typical Redux app would probably have somewhat less memory usage than an equivalent Backbone app because Redux encourages use of plain JavaScript objects and arrays rather than creating instances of Models and Collections. Finally, Redux only holds onto a single state tree reference at a time. Objects that are no longer referenced in that tree will be garbage collected, as usual.Redux does not store a history of actions itself. However, the Redux DevTools do store actions so they can be replayed, but those are generally only enabled during development, and not used in production.Further informationDocumentationDocs: Async Actions\n\nDiscussionsStack Overflow: Is there any way to \"commit\" the state in Redux to free memory?\n\nReddit: What's the best place to keep initial state?\n\nReact ReduxWhy isn't my component re-rendering, or my mapStateToProps running?Accidentally mutating or modifying your state directly is by far the most common reason why components do not re-render after an action has been dispatched. Redux expects that your reducers will update their state “immutably”, which effectively means always making copies of your data, and applying your changes to the copies. If you return the same object from a reducer, Redux assumes that nothing has been changed, even if you made changes to its contents. Similarly, React Redux tries to improve performance by doing shallow equality reference checks on incoming props in shouldComponentUpdate, and if all references are the same, returns false to skip actually updating your original component.It's important to remember that whenever you update a nested value, you must also return new copies of anything above it in your state tree. If you have state.a.b.c.d, and you want to make an update to d, you would also need to return new copies of c, b, a, and state. This state tree mutation diagram demonstrates how a change deep in a tree requires changes all the way up.Note that “updating data immutably” does not mean that you must use Immutable.js, although that is certainly an option. You can do immutable updates to plain JS objects and arrays using several different approaches:Copying objects using functions like Object.assign() or _.extend(), and array functions such as slice() and concat()\n\nThe array spread operator in ES6, and the similar object spread operator that is proposed for a future version of JavaScript\n\nUtility libraries that wrap immutable update logic into simpler functions\n\nFurther informationDocumentationTroubleshooting\n\nReact Redux: Troubleshooting\n\nRecipes: Using the Object Spread Operator\n\nDiscussions#1262: Immutable data + bad performance\n\nReact Redux #235: Predicate function for updating component\n\nReact Redux #291: Should mapStateToProps be called every time an action is dispatched?\n\nStack Overflow: Cleaner/shorter way to update nested state in Redux?\n\nGist: state mutations\n\nPros and Cons of Using Immutability with React\n\nWhy is my component re-rendering too often?React Redux implements several optimizations to ensure your actual component only re-renders when actually necessary. One of those is a shallow equality check on the combined props object generated by the mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps arguments passed to connect. Unfortunately, shallow equality does not help in cases where new array or object instances are created each time mapStateToProps is called. A typical example might be mapping over an array of IDs and returning the matching object references, such as:const mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  return {\n    objects: state.objectIds.map(id => state.objects[id])\n  }\n}\nEven though the array might contain the exact same object references each time, the array itself is a different reference, so the shallow equality check fails and React Redux would re-render the wrapped component.The extra re-renders could be resolved by saving the array of objects into the state using a reducer, caching the mapped array using Reselect, or implementing shouldComponentUpdate in the component by hand and doing a more in-depth props comparison using a function such as _.isEqual. Be careful to not make your custom shouldComponentUpdate() more expensive than the rendering itself! Always use a profiler to check your assumptions about performance.For non-connected components, you may want to check what props are being passed in. A common issue is having a parent component re-bind a callback inside its render function, like . That creates a new function reference every time the parent re-renders. It's generally good practice to only bind callbacks once in the parent component's constructor.Further informationDiscussionsStack Overflow: Can a React Redux app scale as well as Backbone?\n\nReact.js pure render performance anti-pattern\n\nA Deep Dive into React Perf Debugging\n\nHow can I speed up my mapStateToProps?While React Redux does work to minimize the number of times that your mapStateToProps function is called, it's still a good idea to ensure that your mapStateToProps runs quickly and also minimizes the amount of work it does. The common recommended approach is to create memoized “selector” functions using Reselect. These selectors can be combined and composed together, and selectors later in a pipeline will only run if their inputs have changed. This means you can create selectors that do things like filtering or sorting, and ensure that the real work only happens if needed.Further informationDocumentationRecipes: Computed Derived Data\n\nDiscussions#815: Working with Data Structures\n\nReselect #47: Memoizing Hierarchical Selectors\n\nWhy don't I have this.props.dispatch available in my connected component?The connect() function takes two primary arguments, both optional. The first, mapStateToProps, is a function you provide to pull data from the store when it changes, and pass those values as props to your component. The second, mapDispatchToProps, is a function you provide to make use of the store's dispatch function, usually by creating pre-bound versions of action creators that will automatically dispatch their actions as soon as they are called.If you do not provide your own mapDispatchToProps function when calling connect(), React Redux will provide a default version, which simply returns the dispatch function as a prop. That means that if you do provide your own function, dispatch is not automatically provided.  If you still want it available as a prop, you need to explicitly return it yourself in your mapDispatchToProps implementation.Further informationDocumentationReact Redux API: connect()\n\nDiscussionsReact Redux #89: can i wrap multi actionCreators into one props with name?\n\nReact Redux #145: consider always passing down dispatch regardless of what mapDispatchToProps does\n\nReact Redux #255: this.props.dispatch is undefined if using mapDispatchToProps\n\nStack Overflow: How to get simple dispatch from this.props using connect w/ Redux?\n\nShould I only connect my top component, or can I connect multiple components in my tree?Early Redux documentation advised that you should only have a few connected components near the top of your component tree.  However, time and experience has shown that that generally requires a few components to know too much about the data requirements of all their descendants, and forces them to pass down a confusing number of props.The current suggested best practice is to categorize your components as “presentational” or “container” components, and extract a connected container component wherever it makes sense:Emphasizing “one container component at the top” in Redux examples was a mistake. Don't take this as a maxim. Try to keep your presentation components separate. Create container components by connecting them when it's convenient. Whenever you feel like you're duplicating code in parent components to provide data for same kinds of children, time to extract a container. Generally as soon as you feel a parent knows too much about “personal” data or actions of its children, time to extract a container.In general, try to find a balance between understandable data flow and areas of responsibility with your components.Further informationDocumentationBasics: Usage with React\n\nDiscussionsPresentational and Container Components\n\nTwitter: emphasizing “one container” was a mistake\n\n#419: Recommended usage of connect\n\n#756: container vs component?\n\n#1176: Redux+React with only stateless components\n\nStack Overflow: can a dumb component use a Redux container?\n\nMiscellaneousAre there any larger, “real” Redux projects?The Redux “examples” folder has several sample projects of varying complexity, including a “real-world” example.

Why does this happen? There may be several reasons for this.Never mutate reducer argumentsIt is tempting to modify the state or action passed to you by Redux. Don't do this!Redux assumes that you never mutate the objects it gives to you in the reducer. Every single time, you must return the new state object. Even if you don't use a library like Immutable, you need to completely avoid mutation.Immutability is what lets react-redux efficiently subscribe to fine-grained updates of your state. It also enables great developer experience features such as time travel with redux-devtools.For example, a reducer like this is wrong because it mutates the state:function todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      // Wrong! This mutates state\n      state.push({\n        text: action.text,\n        completed: false\n      })\n      return state\n    case 'COMPLETE_TODO':\n      // Wrong! This mutates state[action.index].\n      state[action.index].completed = true\n      return state\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\nIt needs to be rewritten like this:function todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      // Return a new array\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        {\n          text: action.text,\n          completed: false\n        }\n      ]\n    case 'COMPLETE_TODO':\n      // Return a new array\n      return state.map((todo, index) => {\n        if (index === action.index) {\n          // Copy the object before mutating\n          return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n            completed: true\n          })\n        }\n        return todo\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\nIt's more code, but it's exactly what makes Redux predictable and efficient. If you want to have less code, you can use a helper like React.addons.update to write immutable transformations with a terse syntax:// Before:\nreturn state.map((todo, index) => {\n  if (index === action.index) {\n    return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n      completed: true\n    })\n  }\n  return todo\n})\n\n// After\nreturn update(state, {\n  [action.index]: {\n    completed: {\n      $set: true\n    }\n  }\n})\nFinally, to update objects, you'll need something like _.extend from Underscore, or better, an Object.assign polyfill.Make sure that you use Object.assign correctly. For example, instead of returning something like Object.assign(state, newData) from your reducers, return Object.assign({}, state, newData). This way you don't override the previous state.You can also enable the object spread operator proposal for a more succinct syntax:// Before:\nreturn state.map((todo, index) => {\n  if (index === action.index) {\n    return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n      completed: true\n    })\n  }\n  return todo\n})\n\n// After:\nreturn state.map((todo, index) => {\n  if (index === action.index) {\n    return { ...todo, completed: true }\n  }\n  return todo\n})\nNote that experimental language features are subject to change.Don't forget to call dispatch(action)If you define an action creator, calling it will not automatically dispatch the action. For example, this code will do nothing:TodoActions.jsexport function addTodo(text) {\n  return { type: 'ADD_TODO', text }\n}\nAddTodo.jsimport React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport { addTodo } from './TodoActions'\n\nclass AddTodo extends Component {\n  handleClick() {\n    // Won't work!\n    addTodo('Fix the issue')\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n       this.handleClick()}>\n        Add\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\nIt doesn't work because your action creator is just a function that returns an action. It is up to you to actually dispatch it. We can't bind your action creators to a particular Store instance during the definition because apps that render on the server need a separate Redux store for every request.The fix is to call dispatch() method on the store instance:handleClick() {\n  // Works! (but you need to grab store somehow)\n  store.dispatch(addTodo('Fix the issue'))\n}\nIf you're somewhere deep in the component hierarchy, it is cumbersome to pass the store down manually. This is why react-redux lets you use a connect higher-order component that will, apart from subscribing you to a Redux store, inject dispatch into your component's props.The fixed code looks like this:AddTodo.jsimport React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { addTodo } from './TodoActions'\n\nclass AddTodo extends Component {\n  handleClick() {\n    // Works!\n    this.props.dispatch(addTodo('Fix the issue'))\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n       this.handleClick()}>\n        Add\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\n// In addition to the state, `connect` puts `dispatch` in our props.\nexport default connect()(AddTodo)\nYou can then pass dispatch down to other components manually, if you want to.Make sure mapStateToProps is correctIt's possible you're correctly dispatching an action and applying your reducer but the corresponding state is not being correctly translated into props.Something else doesn't workAsk around on the #redux Reactiflux Discord channel, or create an issue.If you figure it out, edit this document as a courtesy to the next person having the same problem."},"docs/Glossary.html":{"url":"docs/Glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"GlossaryThis is a glossary of the core terms in Redux, along with their type signatures. The types are documented using Flow notation.Statetype State = any\nState (also called the state tree) is a broad term, but in the Redux API it usually refers to the single state value that is managed by the store and returned by getState(). It represents the entire state of a Redux application, which is often a deeply nested object.By convention, the top-level state is an object or some other key-value collection like a Map, but technically it can be any type. Still, you should do your best to keep the state serializable. Don't put anything inside it that you can't easily turn into JSON.Actiontype Action = Object\nAn action is a plain object that represents an intention to change the state. Actions are the only way to get data into the store. Any data, whether from UI events, network callbacks, or other sources such as WebSockets needs to eventually be dispatched as actions.Actions must have a type field that indicates the type of action being performed. Types can be defined as constants and imported from another module. It's better to use strings for type than Symbols because strings are serializable.Other than type, the structure of an action object is really up to you. If you're interested, check out Flux Standard Action for recommendations on how actions should be constructed.See also async action below.Reducertype Reducer = (state: S, action: A) => S\nA reducer (also called a reducing function) is a function that accepts an accumulation and a value and returns a new accumulation. They are used to reduce a collection of values down to a single value.Reducers are not unique to Redux—they are a fundamental concept in functional programming.  Even most non-functional languages, like JavaScript, have a built-in API for reducing. In JavaScript, it's Array.prototype.reduce().In Redux, the accumulated value is the state object, and the values being accumulated are actions. Reducers calculate a new state given the previous state and an action. They must be pure functions—functions that return the exact same output for given inputs. They should also be free of side-effects. This is what enables exciting features like hot reloading and time travel.Reducers are the most important concept in Redux.Do not put API calls into reducers.Dispatching Functiontype BaseDispatch = (a: Action) => Action\ntype Dispatch = (a: Action | AsyncAction) => any\nA dispatching function (or simply dispatch function) is a function that accepts an action or an async action; it then may or may not dispatch one or more actions to the store.We must distinguish between dispatching functions in general and the base dispatch function provided by the store instance without any middleware.The base dispatch function always synchronously sends an action to the store's reducer, along with the previous state returned by the store, to calculate a new state. It expects actions to be plain objects ready to be consumed by the reducer.Middleware wraps the base dispatch function. It allows the dispatch function to handle async actions in addition to actions. Middleware may transform, delay, ignore, or otherwise interpret actions or async actions before passing them to the next middleware. See below for more information.Action Creatortype ActionCreator = (...args: any) => Action | AsyncAction\nAn action creator is, quite simply, a function that creates an action. Do not confuse the two terms—again, an action is a payload of information, and an action creator is a factory that creates an action.Calling an action creator only produces an action, but does not dispatch it. You need to call the store's dispatch function to actually cause the mutation. Sometimes we say bound action creators to mean functions that call an action creator and immediately dispatch its result to a specific store instance.If an action creator needs to read the current state, perform an API call, or cause a side effect, like a routing transition, it should return an async action instead of an action.Async Actiontype AsyncAction = any\nAn async action is a value that is sent to a dispatching function, but is not yet ready for consumption by the reducer. It will be transformed by middleware into an action (or a series of actions) before being sent to the base dispatch() function. Async actions may have different types, depending on the middleware you use. They are often asynchronous primitives, like a Promise or a thunk, which are not passed to the reducer immediately, but trigger action dispatches once an operation has completed.Middlewaretype MiddlewareAPI = { dispatch: Dispatch, getState: () => State }\ntype Middleware = (api: MiddlewareAPI) => (next: Dispatch) => Dispatch\nA middleware is a higher-order function that composes a dispatch function to return a new dispatch function. It often turns async actions into actions.Middleware is composable using function composition. It is useful for logging actions, performing side effects like routing, or turning an asynchronous API call into a series of synchronous actions.See applyMiddleware(...middlewares) for a detailed look at middleware.Storetype Store = {\n  dispatch: Dispatch\n  getState: () => State\n  subscribe: (listener: () => void) => () => void\n  replaceReducer: (reducer: Reducer) => void\n}\nA store is an object that holds the application's state tree.There should only be a single store in a Redux app, as the composition happens on the reducer level.dispatch(action) is the base dispatch function described above.\n\ngetState() returns the current state of the store.\n\nsubscribe(listener) registers a function to be called on state changes.\n\nreplaceReducer(nextReducer) can be used to implement hot reloading and code splitting. Most likely you won't use it.\n\nSee the complete store API reference for more details.Store creatortype StoreCreator = (reducer: Reducer, preloadedState: ?State) => Store\nA store creator is a function that creates a Redux store. Like with dispatching function, we must distinguish the base store creator, createStore(reducer, preloadedState) exported from the Redux package, from store creators that are returned from the store enhancers.Store enhancertype StoreEnhancer = (next: StoreCreator) => StoreCreator\nA store enhancer is a higher-order function that composes a store creator to return a new, enhanced store creator. This is similar to middleware in that it allows you to alter the store interface in a composable way.Store enhancers are much the same concept as higher-order components in React, which are also occasionally called “component enhancers”.Because a store is not an instance, but rather a plain-object collection of functions, copies can be easily created and modified without mutating the original store. There is an example in compose documentation demonstrating that.Most likely you'll never write a store enhancer, but you may use the one provided by the developer tools. It is what makes time travel possible without the app being aware it is happening. Amusingly, the Redux middleware implementation is itself a store enhancer."},"docs/api/":{"url":"docs/api/","title":"API Reference","keywords":"","body":"API ReferenceThe Redux API surface is tiny.

You may optionally specify it to hydrate the state from the server in universal apps, or to restore a previously serialized user session. If you produced reducer with combineReducers, this must be a plain object with the same shape as the keys passed to it. Otherwise, you are free to pass anything that your reducer can understand.\n[enhancer] (Function): The store enhancer. You may optionally specify it to enhance the store with third-party capabilities such as middleware, time travel, persistence, etc. The only store enhancer that ships with Redux is applyMiddleware().\nReturns(Store): An object that holds the complete state of your app. The only way to change its state is by dispatching actions.

Instead, use combineReducers to create a single root reducer out of many.\nIt is up to you to choose the state format. You can use plain objects or something like Immutable. If you're not sure, start with plain objects.\nIf your state is a plain object, make sure you never mutate it! For example, instead of returning something like Object.assign(state, newData) from your reducers, return Object.assign({}, state, newData). This way you don't override the previous state. You can also write return { ...state, ...newData } if you enable the object spread operator proposal.\nFor universal apps that run on the server, create a store instance with every request so that they are isolated. Dispatch a few data fetching actions to a store instance and wait for them to complete before rendering the app on the server.\nWhen a store is created, Redux dispatches a dummy action to your reducer to populate the store with the initial state. You are not meant to handle the dummy action directly.

It's just an object with a few methods on it.To create it, pass your root reducing function to createStore.A Note for Flux UsersIf you're coming from Flux, there is a single important difference you need to understand. Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, instead of adding stores, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. You can use a helper like combineReducers to combine them. This is similar to how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.Store MethodsgetState()\n\ndispatch(action)\n\nsubscribe(listener)\n\nreplaceReducer(nextReducer)\n\nStore MethodsgetState()Returns the current state tree of your application.It is equal to the last value returned by the store's reducer.Returns(any): The current state tree of your application.\n\n\n\ndispatch(action)Dispatches an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change.The store's reducing function will be called with the current getState() result and the given action synchronously. Its return value will be considered the next state. It will be returned from getState() from now on, and the change listeners will immediately be notified.A Note for Flux UsersIf you attempt to call dispatch from inside the reducer, it will throw with an error saying “Reducers may not dispatch actions.” This is similar to “Cannot dispatch in a middle of dispatch” error in Flux, but doesn't cause the problems associated with it. In Flux, a dispatch is forbidden while Stores are handling the action and emitting updates. This is unfortunate because it makes it impossible to dispatch actions from component lifecycle hooks or other benign places.In Redux, subscriptions are called after the root reducer has returned the new state, so you may dispatch in the subscription listeners. You are only disallowed to dispatch inside the reducers because they must have no side effects. If you want to cause a side effect in response to an action, the right place to do this is in the potentially async action creator.Argumentsaction (Object†): A plain object describing the change that makes sense for your application. Actions are the only way to get data into the store, so any data, whether from the UI events, network callbacks, or other sources such as WebSockets needs to eventually be dispatched as actions. Actions must have a type field that indicates the type of action being performed. Types can be defined as constants and imported from another module. It's better to use strings for type than Symbols because strings are serializable. Other than type, the structure of an action object is really up to you. If you're interested, check out Flux Standard Action for recommendations on how actions could be constructed.\n\nReturns(Object†): The dispatched action (see notes).Notes† The “vanilla” store implementation you get by calling createStore only supports plain object actions and hands them immediately to the reducer.However, if you wrap createStore with applyMiddleware, the middleware can interpret actions differently, and provide support for dispatching async actions. Async actions are usually asynchronous primitives like Promises, Observables, or thunks.Middleware is created by the community and does not ship with Redux by default. You need to explicitly install packages like redux-thunk or redux-promise to use it. You may also create your own middleware.To learn how to describe asynchronous API calls, read the current state inside action creators, perform side effects, or chain them to execute in a sequence, see the examples for applyMiddleware.Exampleimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nlet store = createStore(todos, [ 'Use Redux' ])\n\nfunction addTodo(text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('Read the docs'))\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('Read about the middleware'))\n\n\n\n\nsubscribe(listener)Adds a change listener. It will be called any time an action is dispatched, and some part of the state tree may potentially have changed. You may then call getState() to read the current state tree inside the callback.You may call dispatch() from a change listener, with the following caveats:The listener should only call dispatch() either in response to user actions or under specific conditions (e. g. dispatching an action when the store has a specific field). Calling dispatch() without any conditions is technically possible, however it leads to infinite loop as every dispatch() call usually triggers the listener again.\nThe subscriptions are snapshotted just before every dispatch() call. If you subscribe or unsubscribe while the listeners are being invoked, this will not have any effect on the dispatch() that is currently in progress. However, the next dispatch() call, whether nested or not, will use a more recent snapshot of the subscription list.\nThe listener should not expect to see all state changes, as the state might have been updated multiple times during a nested dispatch() before the listener is called. It is, however, guaranteed that all subscribers registered before the dispatch() started will be called with the latest state by the time it exits.\nIt is a low-level API. Most likely, instead of using it directly, you'll use React (or other) bindings. If you commonly use the callback as a hook to react to state changes, you might want to write a custom observeStore utility. The Store is also an Observable, so you can subscribe to changes with libraries like RxJS.To unsubscribe the change listener, invoke the function returned by subscribe.Argumentslistener (Function): The callback to be invoked any time an action has been dispatched, and the state tree might have changed. You may call getState() inside this callback to read the current state tree. It is reasonable to expect that the store's reducer is a pure function, so you may compare references to some deep path in the state tree to learn whether its value has changed.\n\nReturns(Function): A function that unsubscribes the change listener.Examplefunction select(state) {\n  return state.some.deep.property\n}\n\nlet currentValue\nfunction handleChange() {\n  let previousValue = currentValue\n  currentValue = select(store.getState())\n\n  if (previousValue !== currentValue) {\n    console.log('Some deep nested property changed from', previousValue, 'to', currentValue)\n  }\n}\n\nlet unsubscribe = store.subscribe(handleChange)\nunsubscribe()\n\n\n\n\nreplaceReducer(nextReducer)Replaces the reducer currently used by the store to calculate the state.It is an advanced API. You might need this if your app implements code splitting, and you want to load some of the reducers dynamically. You might also need this if you implement a hot reloading mechanism for Redux.Argumentsreducer (Function) The next reducer for the store to use.\n\n"},"docs/api/combineReducers.html":{"url":"docs/api/combineReducers.html","title":"combineReducers","keywords":"","body":"combineReducers(reducers)As your app grows more complex, you'll want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state.The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. The shape of the state object matches the keys of the passed reducers.Consequently, the state object will look like this:{\n  reducer1: ...\n  reducer2: ...\n}\nYou can control state key names by using different keys for the reducers in the passed object. For example, you may call combineReducers({ todos: myTodosReducer, counter: myCounterReducer }) for the state shape to be { todos, counter }.A popular convention is to name reducers after the state slices they manage, so you can use ES6 property shorthand notation: combineReducers({ counter, todos }). This is equivalent to writing combineReducers({ counter: counter, todos: todos }).A Note for Flux UsersThis function helps you organize your reducers to manage their own slices of state, similar to how you would have different Flux Stores to manage different state. With Redux, there is just one store, but combineReducers helps you keep the same logical division between reducers.Argumentsreducers (Object): An object whose values correspond to different reducing functions that need to be combined into one. See the notes below for some rules every passed reducer must follow.\n\nEarlier documentation suggested the use of the ES6 import * as reducers syntax to obtain the reducers object. This was the source of a lot of confusion, which is why we now recommend exporting a single reducer obtained using combineReducers() from reducers/index.js instead. An example is included below.Returns(Function): A reducer that invokes every reducer inside the reducers object, and constructs a state object with the same shape.NotesThis function is mildly opinionated and is skewed towards helping beginners avoid common pitfalls. This is why it attempts to enforce some rules that you don't have to follow if you write the root reducer manually.Any reducer passed to combineReducers must satisfy these rules:For any action that is not recognized, it must return the state given to it as the first argument.\nIt must never return undefined. It is too easy to do this by mistake via an early return statement, so combineReducers throws if you do that instead of letting the error manifest itself somewhere else.\nIf the state given to it is undefined, it must return the initial state for this specific reducer. According to the previous rule, the initial state must not be undefined either. It is handy to specify it with ES6 optional arguments syntax, but you can also explicitly check the first argument for being undefined.\nWhile combineReducers attempts to check that your reducers conform to some of these rules, you should remember them, and do your best to follow them. combineReducers will check your reducers by passing undefined to them; this is done even if you specify initial state to Redux.createStore(combinedReducers(...), initialState). Therefore, you must ensure your reducers work properly when receiving undefined as state, even if you never intend for them to actually receive undefined in your own code.Examplereducers/todos.jsexport default function todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return state.concat([ action.text ])\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\nreducers/counter.jsexport default function counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return state + 1\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return state - 1\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\nreducers/index.jsimport { combineReducers } from 'redux'\nimport todos from './todos'\nimport counter from './counter'\n\nexport default combineReducers({\n  todos,\n  counter\n})\nApp.jsimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport reducer from './reducers/index'\n\nlet store = createStore(reducer)\nconsole.log(store.getState())\n// {\n//   counter: 0,\n//   todos: []\n// }\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  text: 'Use Redux'\n})\nconsole.log(store.getState())\n// {\n//   counter: 0,\n//   todos: [ 'Use Redux' ]\n// }\nTipsThis helper is just a convenience! You can write your own combineReducers that works differently, or even assemble the state object from the child reducers manually and write a root reducing function explicitly, like you would write any other function.\nYou may call combineReducers at any level of the reducer hierarchy. It doesn't have to happen at the top. In fact you may use it again to split the child reducers that get too complicated into independent grandchildren, and so on.\n"},"docs/api/applyMiddleware.html":{"url":"docs/api/applyMiddleware.html","title":"applyMiddleware","keywords":"","body":"applyMiddleware(...middlewares)Middleware is the suggested way to extend Redux with custom functionality. Middleware lets you wrap the store's dispatch method for fun and profit. The key feature of middleware is that it is composable. Multiple middleware can be combined together, where each middleware requires no knowledge of what comes before or after it in the chain.The most common use case for middleware is to support asynchronous actions without much boilerplate code or a dependency on a library like Rx. It does so by letting you dispatch async actions in addition to normal actions.For example, redux-thunk lets the action creators invert control by dispatching functions. They would receive dispatch as an argument and may call it asynchronously. Such functions are called thunks. Another example of middleware is redux-promise. It lets you dispatch a Promise async action, and dispatches a normal action when the Promise resolves.Middleware is not baked into createStore and is not a fundamental part of the Redux architecture, but we consider it useful enough to be supported right in the core. This way, there is a single standard way to extend dispatch in the ecosystem, and different middleware may compete in expressiveness and utility.Arguments...middlewares (arguments): Functions that conform to the Redux middleware API. Each middleware receives Store's dispatch and getState functions as named arguments, and returns a function. That function will be given the next middleware's dispatch method, and is expected to return a function of action calling next(action) with a potentially different argument, or at a different time, or maybe not calling it at all. The last middleware in the chain will receive the real store's dispatch method as the next parameter, thus ending the chain. So, the middleware signature is ({ getState, dispatch }) => next => action.\n\nReturns(Function) A store enhancer that applies the given middleware. The store enhancer signature is createStore => createStore' but the easiest way to apply it is to pass it to createStore() as the last enhancer argument.Example: Custom Logger Middlewareimport { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport todos from './reducers'\n\nfunction logger({ getState }) {\n  return (next) => (action) => {\n    console.log('will dispatch', action)\n\n    // Call the next dispatch method in the middleware chain.\n    let returnValue = next(action)\n\n    console.log('state after dispatch', getState())\n\n    // This will likely be the action itself, unless\n    // a middleware further in chain changed it.\n    return returnValue\n  }\n}\n\nlet store = createStore(\n  todos,\n  [ 'Use Redux' ],\n  applyMiddleware(logger)\n)\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  text: 'Understand the middleware'\n})\n// (These lines will be logged by the middleware:)\n// will dispatch: { type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Understand the middleware' }\n// state

Technically, anything a middleware can do, you can do manually by wrapping every dispatch call, but it's easier to manage this in a single place and define action transformations on the scale of the whole project.\nIf you use other store enhancers in addition to applyMiddleware, make sure to put applyMiddleware before them in the composition chain because the middleware is potentially asynchronous. For example, it should go before redux-devtools because otherwise the DevTools won't see the raw actions emitted by the Promise middleware and such.\nIf you want to conditionally apply a middleware, make sure to only import it when it's needed:let middleware = [ a, b ]\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n  let c = require('some-debug-middleware')\n  let d = require('another-debug-middleware')\n  middleware = [ ...middleware, c, d ]\n}\n\nconst store = createStore(\n  reducer,\n  preloadedState,\n  applyMiddleware(...middleware)\n)\nThis makes it easier for bundling tools to cut out unneeded modules and reduces the size of your builds.\nEver wondered what applyMiddleware itself is? It ought to be an extension mechanism more powerful than the middleware itself. Indeed, applyMiddleware is an example of the most powerful Redux extension mechanism called store enhancers. It is highly unlikely you'll ever want to write a store enhancer yourself. Another example of a store enhancer is redux-devtools. Middleware is less powerful than a store enhancer, but it is easier to write.\nMiddleware sounds much more complicated than it really is. The only way to really understand middleware is to see how the existing middleware works, and try to write your own. The function nesting can be intimidating, but most of the middleware you'll find are, in fact, 10-liners, and the nesting and composability is what makes the middleware system powerful.\nTo apply multiple store enhancers, you may use compose().\n"},"docs/api/bindActionCreators.html":{"url":"docs/api/bindActionCreators.html","title":"bindActionCreators","keywords":"","body":"bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch)Turns an object whose values are action creators, into an object with the same keys, but with every action creator wrapped into a dispatch call so they may be invoked directly.Normally you should just call dispatch directly on your Store instance. If you use Redux with React, react-redux will provide you with the dispatch function so you can call it directly, too.The only use case for bindActionCreators is when you want to pass some action creators down to a component that isn't aware of Redux, and you don't want to pass dispatch or the Redux store to it.For convenience, you can also pass a single function as the first argument, and get a function in return.ParametersactionCreators (Function or Object): An action creator, or an object whose values are action creators.\ndispatch (Function): A dispatch function available on the Store instance.\nReturns(Function or Object): An object mimicking the original object, but with each function immediately dispatching the action returned by the corresponding action creator. If you passed a function as actionCreators, the return value will also be a single function.ExampleTodoActionCreators.jsexport function addTodo(text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nexport function removeTodo(id) {\n  return {\n    type: 'REMOVE_TODO',\n    id\n  }\n}\nSomeComponent.jsimport { Component } from 'react'\nimport { bindActionCreators } from 'redux'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\nimport * as TodoActionCreators from './TodoActionCreators'\nconsole.log(TodoActionCreators)\n// {\n//   addTodo: Function,\n//   removeTodo: Function\n// }\n\nclass TodoListContainer extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    // Injected by react-redux:\n    let { dispatch } = this.props\n\n    // Note: this won't work:\n    // TodoActionCreators.addTodo('Use Redux')\n\n    // You're just calling a function that creates an action.\n    // You must dispatch the action, too!\n\n    // This will work:\n    let action = TodoActionCreators.addTodo('Use Redux')\n    dispatch(action)\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // Injected by react-redux:\n    let { todos, dispatch } = this.props\n\n    // Here's a good use case for bindActionCreators:\n    // You want a child component to be completely unaware of Redux.\n\n    let boundActionCreators = bindActionCreators(TodoActionCreators, dispatch)\n    console.log(boundActionCreators)\n    // {\n    //   addTodo: Function,\n    //   removeTodo: Function\n    // }\n\n    return (\n      \n    )\n\n    // An alternative to bindActionCreators is to pass\n    // just the dispatch function down, but then your child component\n    // needs to import action creators and know about them.\n\n    // return \n  }\n}\n\nexport default connect(\n  state => ({ todos: state.todos })\n)(TodoListContainer)\nTipsYou might ask: why don't we bind the action creators to the store instance right away, like in classical Flux? The problem is that this won't work well with universal apps that need to render on the server. Most likely you want to have a separate store instance per request so you can prepare them with different data, but binding action creators during their definition means you're stuck with a single store instance for all requests.\nIf you use ES5, instead of import * as syntax you can just pass require('./TodoActionCreators') to bindActionCreators as the first argument. The only thing it cares about is that the values of the actionCreators arguments are functions. The module system doesn't matter.\n"},"docs/api/compose.html":{"url":"docs/api/compose.html","title":"compose","keywords":"","body":"compose(...functions)Composes functions from right to left.This is a functional programming utility, and is included in Redux as a convenience.You might want to use it to apply several store enhancers in a row.Arguments(arguments): The functions to compose. Each function is expected to accept a single parameter. Its return value will be provided as an argument to the function standing to the left, and so on. The exception is the right-most argument which can accept multiple parameters, as it will provide the signature for the resulting composed function.\n\nReturns(Function): The final function obtained by composing the given functions from right to left.ExampleThis example demonstrates how to use compose to enhance a store with applyMiddleware and a few developer tools from the redux-devtools package.import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux'\nimport thunk from 'redux-thunk'\nimport DevTools from './containers/DevTools'\nimport reducer from '../reducers/index'\n\nconst store = createStore(\n  reducer,\n  compose(\n    applyMiddleware(thunk),\n    DevTools.instrument()\n  )\n)\nTipsAll compose does is let you write deeply nested function transformations without the rightward drift of the code.
